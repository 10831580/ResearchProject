      "newly sworn members of the council of state let me start by congratulating all you distinguished ladies and gentlemen on your membership of the council of state some of you are here by virtue of institutional representation one exofficio and the others with the support of parliament some by virtue of having been elected as regional representatives and others having been appointed directly by the president of the republic we have no living former chief justice unfortunately to complete the composition whichever route you have taken you are now all members of this very august institution which in the wisdom of our constitution is the body to counsel the president in the performance of his functions members of the council our elders say that it is always better to get the benefit of two or more opinions than to rely on one viewpoint i believe the akan saying is tikro nko agyina in our custom therefore no matter how smart or how well endowed every chief or leader has a group of elders to advise him or her you are that body and luckily for me you come from different backgrounds and have a wide range of competence and experience which if properly harnessed will enable you perform effectively this all important function to this end it is my expectation and i believe the expectation of the entire nation that you will elect from among you a chairperson who will be equal to this task in our tradition of praise singing and grand titles it must be very tempting for a president to lapse into thinking that he is all powerful and able to do whatever he wants we have had the experience of presidents being accorded long and elaborate titles and being told that they are all powerful and cannot be contradicted members of the council it is in the light of such experience that the framers of our constitution found it necessary to establish a council of state to give impartial and objective advice to the president it is important therefore that regardless of whatever your background you would discharge your duties dispassionately this means that the council has a great responsibility it would be easy to fall into the wellknown temptation of telling the president what you think he wants to hear it would be equally tempting to tell the president he is the best thing that ever happened to ghana and it would be even more tempting to tell the president to ignore his critics i expect this council will not walk this road after almost  years of the  republic i think it is fair to say that the most effective council of state we have had has been the one that worked with president john agyekum kufuor we saw an intellectually vibrant and active council that took its responsibilities seriously we saw a council that kept its members well informed and kept government officials on their toes members of the council in my view the council is not an extension of the executive and you will not thus be representing the president or his ministers at functions i look forward very much to working with a council that will offer me straightforward advice based on unvarnished truth i look forward to working with a council that will help all of us deepen our democracy and i look forward to working with a council that will help us deliver a prosperous ghana such a council should not give advice to a president the effect of which is to undermine the independence of any of the other arms of government especially the judiciary the council has a broad scope of advisory functions in counselling the president it plays an important advisory role in the appointment of high officials of state like the chief justice of the republic the governor of the bank of ghana the heads of the nations security services officials of the presidents office and other critical officers of the state again according to article  the president can request the council to consider amendments to bills either before they are passed or even after they are passed by parliament further article  of the constitution gives the council what appears to be an unfettered remit to advise other bodies like parliament or any other authority in my view this is not meant to be a busybody charter but on matters of significant national importance the council can let its views be known there is though an important specific function which the constitution has conferred upon the council the council is to advise the president on the suitability or otherwise of the creation of a new region the councils advice is an integral part of the process for creating new regions this function is certainly going to be exercised during my presidency members of the council article   of the constitution requires the council to meet at least four times in a year at the moment i fear there is a lot of work piled up for the council and it might well turn out to be more like four times in a week that the council meets to be able to deal with the work on its table between the council and the presidency we have a lot of work to do to get all the appointments in place to get the government machinery to work i hope that we shall not insist on standing on ceremony but get to work rapidly and efficiently you can if you should so choose quickly get into the honourable and excellency mode and you will find many people to play you up to that role you can if you should so choose make your council one that is a rubber stamp you can if you should so choose make this council one that is widely respected and seen as the place to go for advice by all institutions and i am hoping this council will choose the latter path members of the council i have been given to understand that the state of the infrastructure for the council is not good work on the building started under president kufuor to house the council has been abandoned and the guest house for the use of members who come from out of town has also fallen into disrepair i hear the vehicles the council uses are in a poor state and i understand the secretariat has not got a chief director or a full complement of staff to help it perform its duties this is an unfortunate state of affairs i shall do my best to ensure that these matters are rectified promptly and the council is properly equipped to do its work members of the council you have been sworn into office at a difficult time in the history of our nation our economy is in poor shape we have challenges of governance especially the issue of corruption in public life we need to enhance the efficiency of the states administrative machinery in all these i expect you to be proactive partners in our efforts to find solutions that will improve the lives of our people i look forward to a vigorous exchange of ideas between us and it is my fervent wish and hope that this council will help enrich my presidency for the benefit of the ghanaian people so that together we can help realise the dreams of the founders of our nation to build a free united prosperous and happy ghana on the basis of the principles of democratic accountability respect for human rights and the rule of law and the dictates of social justice thank you may god bless you and bless our homeland ghana  ghana is a west african country bound on the north by burkina faso on the east by togo on the south by the atlantic oceanand on the west by côte divoire jubilee house

      "we are gathered here this afternoon to perform one of the most significant acts in the life of our nation – the induction into office of a new chief justice of the republic it has been a simple solemn ceremony of investiture of the head of the judiciary the third arm of government to that end i am grateful for the presence of all of you many of you current or past holders of high public or other office especially for the presence of two of my predecessors the former presidents of the republic their excellencies jerry john rawlings and john agyekum kufuor my immediate predecessor his excellency john dramani mahama is as the lawyers say absent from the jurisdiction their participation in these proceedings speaks not only of the continuity of the institutions of the fourth republic for which we thank god but testifies also to the national character of this event the ghanaian people on tuesday  april  adopted by an overwhelming margin the provisions of the constitution of the fourth republic in the referendum of that day and resolved thereby to build under god a nation with a functioning democracy founded on the rule of law the commitment they made still resounds strongly twenty five years later and one of the most important actors in the preservation of this is the chief justice the decision in favour of multiparty democracy based on the separation of powers was guided by their belief that this was the surest path to progress and prosperity for our nation they did so in the words of the preamble of the constitution which with your indulgence i shall quote in extenso on this appropriate occasion in exercise of our natural and inalienable right to establish a framework of government which shall secure for ourselves and posterity the blessings of liberty equality of opportunity and prosperity  in a spirit of friendship and peace with all peoples of the world  and in solemn declaration and affirmation of our commitment to  freedom justice probity and accountability  the principle that all powers of government spring from the sovereign will of the people  the principle of universal adult suffrage  the rule of law  the protection and preservation of fundamental human rights and freedoms unity and stability for our nation  these brave words capture the essence of much of our history our unhappy experience with authoritarian rule and our determination to enter into a new era of freedom justice probity and accountability they have provided the platform for the fourth republic ushering us into the longest uninterrupted stable constitutional governance of independent ghana long may that continue so it is that final judicial power in the state under our constitution is vested solely in the judiciary and not in any other agency or organ of the state be it the presidency or the parliament the judiciary has jurisdiction in all matters of the breach of the law civil and criminal including matters relating to the interpretation and enforcement of the constitution it has thus onerous responsibilities to protect the individual liberties and fundamental human rights of citizens to act as the arbiter in disputes between the state and the citizen to act as the arbiter in disputes between citizens and to serve as the bulwark for the promotion of the orderly development of our nation and for the defence of the liberties and the rights of our people thus far the judiciary can be said generally to have discharged in the fourth republic its duties creditably and responsibly even though i was on the wrong end of the decision in the famous election petition of  a favourable decision on the day could have meant perhaps that this was my second term in office rather than the commencement of my mandate the attachment of the ghanaian people to the rule of law made it possible for us in the new patriotic party to entrust our fate to the highest court in the land in the aftermath of the disputed elections of  it also enabled the country to move on in unity and stability after the court handed down its verdict ghanaian democracy was enhanced by the decision of then chief justice georgina wood to broadcast the proceedings of the petition on television it helped in the process of demystifying judicial proceedings and helped send the clear message from the majority on the court that the controlling principle of judicial intervention in elections was the result delivered at the polling station which would not be easily reversed by a court it is a salutary message eleven days ago and three days short of ten years as chief justice georgina theodora wood stepped down from office into retirement as the twelfth chief justice the first female to head the judiciary and its longest serving leader her career has been extraordinary truly historic and amongst others she has the enviable record of having sworn into office three presidents of the republic the ultimate test of her leadership came two years ago during the dramatic exposé of corruption in the judiciary by one of the nations leading investigative journalists we have not yet lived down the trauma of the excruciating shock and embarrassment of seeing officers of our courts in such compromising situations she however quickly rose to the challenge and introduced reforms to restore some dignity to the judiciary and reestablish the confidence of ghanaians in it i pay warm tribute to her distinguished service to our nation and wish her a wellearned retirement even though her public service is still not over as she has now to take her place on the council of state as a former chief justice president kufuors judgement in selecting her for the office has been roundly vindicated it is critical for the growth of our nation that we have a judiciary that commands the respect of the people by the nature of its delivery of justice as well as by the comportment of its judges it is vitally important that we have judges who are honest possess integrity and a sound knowledge of the law the situation where judges proffer judgements on the basis of decisions from lower courts and cite them as law is not acceptable and even less so when judges cite no authority at all for their rulings and give orders without reasons our judges must be learned know their case law and ensure that their judgements are properly motivated that is the only way the rule of precedent the principle of stare decisis can operate which according to the wellknown common law doctrine promotes the evenhanded predictable and consistent development of legal principles fosters reliance on judicial decisions and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process i am confident that justice sophia abena boafoa akuffo will be an effective leader of the judiciary and will guard jealously its independence she will bring honour to the judiciary and to our country her attributes befitting the offspring of a prominent presbyterian priest – hard work discipline capacity for detailed research intimate knowledge of the law independence of mind and spirit honesty and integrity deepseated respect for the rule of law and for the best traditions of the legal profession abiding belief in the sovereignty of almighty god – will serve her well these are the characteristics which sustained her brilliant career as a lawyer and which propelled her to the notice of the  president of the  republic his excellency jerry john rawlings who appointed her to the supreme court on  november  some  years ago justice akuffo since then has been one of the leading lights of the court and her contribution to the courts work and the growth of our nations jurisprudence has been extensive she has justified the confidence reposed in her by president rawlings she has now to justify the confidence i am reposing in her as chief justice i congratulate her very much on her welldeserved appointment she will be walking in the footsteps of the twelve previous occupants of the office whose names read like a veritable whoswho of ghanas legal profession – arku korsah julius sarkodee addo edward akufoaddo ea lankwei bannerman samuel azu crabbe fred apaloo enp sowah philip archer isaac abban edward wiredu george acquah and gerogina wood i have no doubt however that in her we have a worthy successor to chief justice wood and the others who have gone before her i am certain that she will continue with chief justice woods agenda – redeeming the image of the judiciary and strengthening its accountability proceeding with the modernisation of judicial activities and establishing more specialist courts to improve the quality of judicial administration these should be the hallmarks of her tenure as chief justice i assure her of the full cooperation of my government as a genuine and trusted partner so that together the executive and the judiciary can cooperate in a spirit of mutual respect to realise the welfare and progress of our people i thank the leadership and members of the legislature parliament for the expeditious manner in which the parliamentary process of approval was undertaken in her case i use this occasion to assure the country that my government will not shield anyone found to have broken the laws of this country application of the laws of the land must occur in the words of the judicial oath without fear or favour affection or illwill and therefore without recourse to the political religious or ethnic affiliations of any citizen of the land when you fall foul of the law you must be dealt with accordingly and the law enforcement agencies including the judiciary must ensure this is done to persons perpetrating acts of lawlessness in the name of being members of the ruling party let me make it clear to you that you will find no shield in my government from the law recent disturbances in savelugu for example where allegedly a handful of party executives and youth are trying to prevent the municipal chief executive who has been duly appointed with the requisite approval of the municipal assembly from working are obviously unacceptable i urge the police to do everything in their power to bring to book all those who fall foul of the law we cannot have development which will bring jobs to our youth without order with the office of the special prosecutor in the offing to ensure the prosecution of public officials past and present who engage in acts of corruption and financial malfeasance it is my expectation that the judiciary will help facilitate the work of this body  let me extend my appreciation to justice william atuguba for holding the fort even if briefly as acting chief justice during the period of the retirement of chief justice georgina wood and the swearing into office today of chief justice sophia akuffo i observed that during the vetting process of justice sophia akuffo in parliament on friday june  he together with other members of the supreme court were present in parliament to lend their support to her nomination this was a highly commendable gesture i am hopeful that this same level of support will be extended as she assumes the mantle of head of the judiciary to her colleagues on the bench and to members of the bar i urge your continued solidarity and cooperation with the new chief justice to promote the rule of law that will be in line with the finest traditions of the bench and the bar and will help advance the welfare of our people we are determined to build a new ghanaian civilisation where the rule of law is not a slogan but an operating principle for the development of our state where the separation of powers is real and meaningful where public officials behave with honesty and integrity where the liberties and rights of our people are fully protected and where law and order provide a firm basis for our social and economic development so that the dreams of freedom and prosperity that animated the great patriots who founded our nation can find expression in our generation all of us from the public sector the security agencies the private sector the political parties the civil society the religious bodies and the traditional authorities have a joint responsibility to work together with our different views and our different perspectives for the ghana project – a united ghana governed according to the rule of law respect for individual liberties human rights and the principles of democratic accountability a ghana that meets fundamental requirements of social justice and solidarity and a ghana where we look past commodities to position our country in the global marketplace we should all work to free ourselves from a mindset of dependence aid charity and handouts and rather concentrate on mobilising ghanas own considerable resources to resolve ghanas problems it is a collective enterprise to which we should all commit ourselves in unity and in sincerity for my part i have an unshakeable faith in the boundless prospects of ghanas future and will work for it the radiance of the black star i wish chief justice sophia akuffo well and gods guidance in the discharge of her great functions thank you and may god bless us all and our homeland ghana and make her great and strong  ghana is a west african country bound on

observe a minutes silence in their memories in recognition of their services to the nation may their souls rest in perfect peace today january  is exactly  years since the constitution of the republic came into force and the republic duly inaugurated on january  ie its silver jubilee the constitution became effective following the decision of the ghanaian people given in overwhelming numbers to adopt it as the fundamental law of the land in the referendum of april  the vote was three million four hundred and eight thousand one hundred and nineteen  representing  in favour with two hundred and seventy two thousand eight hundred and fifty five  against ie a mere  it was thus promulgated with immense popular backing and on that seminal day his excellency jerry john rawlings was sworn into

experienced the longest uninterrupted period of stable constitutional governance in our history banishing the spectre of instability that disfigured the early years of our nations existence and the benefits are showing we have witnessed sustained growths in the size of the economy rising levels of per capita real incomes systematic expansion of the private sector taken strong measures to try to protect our lands water bodies and environment from the menace of environmental degradation ensured that efforts to meet the most basic elements of social justice ie education from kindergarten

reached the potential we should have the biggest challenge we face continues to be eradicating widespread poverty we still have challenges in the performance of our public services we face threats traditional and contemporary to our nations security and social stability in the form of chieftaincy conflicts land disputes ethnic conflicts vigilantism cyber security issues youth unemployment economic hardships and corruption in our public life but the fundamental commitment to resolving these challenges within a framework of due process must be unshaken primarily we have begun to take a deep look at the structure of our economy and transform it from a raw material producing and exporting one to a valueadded industrialised economy with a modernised agriculture to serve better our needs the era of ghanas industrialisation has dawned so that we can trade in the global marketplace not on the basis of raw materials but on the basis of things we make inspired by our sense of

promptly rose to the challenge you assisted me to appoint my excellent team of ministers and constitute the government in record time i understand that since the inception of the republic this the  has been the busiest parliament you have had  days of sittings and i am told no parliament in its first session has done more than  days this is to the collective credit of members on both sides of the house and your respective leaderships with the backing of the right honourable speaker and his deputies in the process this parliament has passed a number of bills relating to my flagship programmes again i am told it is a first in the republic that flagship programmes and in this case as many as five have been passed in the first year of the government i am grateful and look forward to our continuing to work together to make our nation ghana great and strong  mr speaker i believe that last year when i came to the house i conveyed my dismay at the full extent of the economic mess in which our nation was mired we had inherited an economy that was in distress choked by debt and with macroeconomic fundamentals in disarray  you would recall mr speaker that i said we would have to implement some tough prudent and innovative policies to get us out of the financial cul de sac we were in i made some brave predictions i said we would reduce significantly the budget deficit and i said that at the same time we would grow and expand the economy i am glad to be able to report that the economic management team under the stellar leadership of the strong brilliant economist vice president mahamudu bawumia has risen to the challenge and the hard work is beginning to show positive results we have reduced taxes we are bringing down inflation and interest rates economic growth is increasing from the alarming  at december  to  in our first year and the indications are that it will be even better this year we have increased our international reserves maintained relative exchange rate stability reduced the debt to gdp ratio and the rate of debt accumulation we have paid almost half of arrears inherited and cruciallywe are current on obligations to statutory funds i am also pleased to report that the  imfsupported extended credit facility programme begun in  comes to an end this year the relatively good macroeconomic performance in  will strongly support our successful completion of the imf programme we are determined to put in place measures to ensure irreversibility and sustain macroeconomic stability so that we will have no reason to seek again the assistance of that powerful global body mr speaker we have restored teacher and nursing training allowances we have doubled the capitation grant and to confound the sceptics and professional naysayers we have implemented free senior high school education it has enabled  more students gain access to senior high school education in  than in  mr speaker we have nevertheless been able to meet my promise made last year to the house and reduced the fiscal deficit from  to an estimated  of gdp as i promised our economists have found imaginative ways to deal with the oppressive debt situation this has brought some relief and the annual average rate of debt accumulation which in recent years has been as high as  has declined to  as at september  as a result the public debt stock as a ratio of gdp is  against the annual target of  for  and end  actual figure of  as a result of appropriate policy and the normalisation of the power situation in the country they have also engineered a spectacular revival of ghanaian industry from a growth rate of  in  to  in  mr speaker i do not suggest in any way that these headlinegrabbing figures mean we are anywhere near resolving our economic problems i am saying to borrow the language of the economists that for the first time in a long while our macroeconomic fundamentals are solid and all the critical indices are pointing in the right direction and the world is taking notice of ghanas economic strides earlier in january the world bank stated that ghanas economy would probably grow by  this year which would make it the fastest growing economy in the world and then last week bloomberg described ghanas stock exchange as the bestperforming stock exchange in the world for january  the report illustrated how the ghana stock exchange composite index has gained  since the start of the year in dollar terms ahead of the nigerian chinese and brazilian stock markets ken oforiatta the finance minister is proving to be a national asset i know that when it comes to the economy many of us have very low tolerance for what we consider as boring figures and we do not see that they affect the reality of our everyday lives but as i said earlier in the year this current set of boring figures happens to spell good news for our economy there are figures that the most innumerate among us can relate to and which can hardly be described as boring i refer to the figures that emerge when you look at the difference between sole sourcing of government procurement and opening it to tender in  the public procurement authority had six hundred and twenty two  sole source requests five hundred and ninety seven  of that number  were approved and there were  rejections there were five hundred and ninety two  requests made for restricted tenders and five hundred and eighty seven   were approved and there were five  rejections a grand total of zero savings was made in  my first year in office three hundred and ninety four  sole sourcing requests were made out of which two hundred and twenty three   were approved and one hundred and seventy one   rejected there were three hundred and forty six  requests for restricted tenders out of which one hundred and sixty seven   were approved and one hundred and seventy nine   rejected now here is the interesting part the savings made over the year as a result amounted to some gh¢ million mr speaker the savings are spectacular and the figures are impressive and as my old mathematics teacher and i suspect everybody elses mathematics teacher would say you cannot argue with figures we have taken the lessons to heart and continue to improve upon the government procurement process i said i would protect the public purse and that is exactly what i am doing i believe it bears repeating here that thanks to these boring figures for the first time in a long while we have been able to provide better budgetary support to the constitutionallymandated institutions that hold government accountable ie auditorgeneral parliament judiciary ministry of justice commission on human rights and administrative justice chraj the economic and organised crime office eoco and the police again nowhere near the levels we would all like but when you are starting from inside a deep hole it takes a while to make an impression on the ground and the good thing is that we are pointing in the right direction  mr speaker thanks to the diligence of the hardworking minister for employment and labour relations hon ignatius baffuor awuah mp for sunyani west we have been able to transfer some gh¢ billion of tier  pension funds into the custodial accounts of the pension schemes of the labour unions funds that have been outstanding for six years and about which the labour unions had been loudly complaining as a result of engagements with organised labour we ensured that the national daily minimum wage was determined and approved before the laying of the  budget by the minister for finance and happily mr speaker there were no strike actions last year we will continue the constructive dialogue with organised labour to find mutually satisfactory solutions to their concerns in order to guarantee industrial peace mr speaker we are therefore able to say with confidence that we are creating the atmosphere needed for the creation of jobs easily the most urgent problem that faces the government and the nation we have put in place the structures to help small and medium scale enterprises and budding entrepreneurs through the challenging startup years the availability of cheaper credit is good news for business in general and means better prospects for jobs mr speaker the subject of job creation has to be at the top of my agenda the number of young people who cannot find work is staggering and a threat to our national security i am determined to work to guarantee and secure the future of the young men and women of our country every major policy that my government has implemented in the past year has been essentially about the youth we will equip the youth with the skills that will enable them to be productive as a start this government has established the nation builders corps to employ  young persons in  alone to assist in public sector service delivery in health education agriculture sanitation and the revenue collection department of the ghana revenue authority gra stakeholders have had a series of meetings on this policy and the modules have been designed for each of the designated areas the details are currently being finetuned and next month this policy will formally take off to join the other youth employment initiatives just this morning the respected senior minister yaw osafo maafo launched the digital marketing and entrepreneurship programme at the accra digital centre this programme with ten regional training centres has already recruited  young unemployed people to undergo a  allexpensespaid training i am happy to announce that ecobank ghana ltd has already offered to engage all  young people after the training programme this is just the tip of the iceberg mr speaker for years we have all talked about the need to open up our country we have all acknowledged that we cannot hope to develop and transform our nation until we do so and economic and administrative activities are spread around and not restricted to the capital in accra we have taken the clear and unambiguous mandate given to this government by the people of ghana as a spur to take some of these long promised actions indeed to open up our country and transform our economy this year we are determined to take the decisions that would change the destiny of our country on the first working day of this year i signed into law the acts setting up the development authorities mr speaker the creation of these authorities marks a fundamental change in how part of the development budget ie the equivalent of  million per constituency per year is going to be spent in our country  local people will make the decision on what their greatest needs are and direct the funds to those areas luckily there is some consensus on what constitutes the basic infrastructure needs in all communities and we expect a smooth takeoff in the work of these authorities we are asking that everybody is guided by the priorities set up in the npp manifesto on which we fought and won the mandate of the ghanaian people we expect for example the provision of water and toilets to feature prominently on the agenda of the development authorities until those two items can be taken off the mustdo list of all constituencies around the country sixty years after independence the least we can and should do is to make sure that every ghanaian has access to water and toilet facilities mr speaker the state of sanitation in our cities is wholly unacceptable our cities have been engulfed by filth there is the urgent need for public authorities to find means of making our cities clean and in the case of accra fulfilling my pledge one of the most ambitious of my presidency to make it the cleanest city in africa by the end of my term government is working with various private sector operators to tackle this major challenge with strategies that are intended to effect a change in our attitudes towards waste generation as well as to improve dramatically our methods of waste management this will be complemented by the strict enforcement of sanitation rules and regulations urgent attention will be given to clearing of rubbish all around the country apart from the systematic efforts being made to resolve the legacy of inherited debts in the sector government will spend this year an amount of gh¢ million to address the vexed issue of sanitation i am confident that by the time i come back next year god willing an appreciable improvement would have been made in the sanitation situation in the country mr speaker there have been a number of ambitious decentralization exercises in this country we are currently engaged in the very big exercise of creating new regions it is a long and rathercomplicated process we are in unchartered territory but all the indications are that it is going well and i have been impressed to see political opponents come together to argue for example the case for the creation of an oti or north volta region it is not often you see the veteran statesman dr obed asamoah the vocal mr kofi adams and the volta regional minister dr archibald letsa on the same side in a public argument this portends well and i believe this exercise will be a success especially as it is being undertaken with scrupulous adherence to the teachings of the constitution in this sensitive area under the skilful direction of the experienced minister for regional reorganisation and development hon dan botwe mp for okere mr speaker yet another ambitious decentralisation exercise is the expansion of full democracy to local government a critical step to this end is the direct election of metropolitan municipal and district chief executives on a partisan basis it is a firm manifesto commitment of the new patriotic party further my discussions with the nations political leaders including the former presidents of the republic convince me that it is a step we must take the constitutional impediment to this in article  of the constitution an entrenched clause must therefore be removed to ensure the judicious use of the countrys resources i propose that the constitutional processes for a referendum should be initiated in such a manner that the holding of the referendum will take place at the same time as next years district assembly elections if successful the outcome of the referendum will mean that the current set of mmdces will be the last batch of chief executives to be appointed under the current system i have no doubt that the resourceful minister for local government and rural development hajia alima mahama mp for nalerigu gambaga will be able to shepherd this process to a positive conclusion but mr speaker i am convinced that the creation of new regions alone would not open up our country that would not on its own convince our young people that they do not have to come to accra to make a living we have to improve upon the transportation system so that no part of this country feels cut off or can be deemed to be too far from the centre that is one of the most effective ways to stop the unsustainable rush to accra traffic jams and overcrowding are making our capital unattractive there are certain inconveniences that people adjust to traffic jams are not one of them we are spending too much time stuck in traffic it is unproductive it is not healthy and it is expensive i fear that one of these days one more car will join the madness on the roads in accra and our city will be completely gridlocked mr speaker we have to build the roads to open up and link up the various parts of the country journey times between parts of the country have to be reduced it is a shame that somesevenyears or so after work had started on the eastern corridor roads we are nowhere near completion and yet this is a strategic road that would provide a much shorter and cheaper link between the southern and northern parts of our country and a suitable alternative route for our landlocked neighbours unfortunately this network of roads has suffered from deliberate unproductive propaganda it is hard to believe that at a time when cocoa prices were going down contracts were awarded for three sections of the road to be funded by cocobod it comes as no surprise that cocobod has issued directives to suspend work on all three sections which come up to almost  kilometres mr speaker we are determined to find the needed resources to complete the eastern corridor roads as i have heard it said among the ewes that which is important you cook in an important pot mr speakernu veve la wo dane le eze veve me there is a crying need for work to be done on all our roads the western corridor the central corridor trunk roads feeder roads town roads around the country all require urgent attention we are determined to bring our road network to a befitting status and this year we shall witness much more activity on the roads in our current economic circumstances we are turning our attention to private sector participation to raise the funds to do what needs to be done i must make mention of the work being done to restore the accratema motorway to its iconic status with help from japan a loyal friend of ghana work is starting to build a threetier interchange at the motorway roundabout and the plans for expansion into a sixlane motorway will be implemented from this year mr speaker if we are to open up our country we have to build a fast safe and reliable railway network last year i made a brave assertion in this house by stating that the takoradi to paga railway would be initiated in the year  i am happy to report that we are making progress we are in the final stages of agreeing with a significant investor the terms of a bot agreement from takoradi to kumasi which will be presented to parliament this session there is already a contractor on site for the construction of the kojokrom to manso section of the takoradi to kumasi rail line the process has commenced to select a suitable partner for the construction of the eastern line from accra to tema to kumasi we aim to break ground this year the central spine from kumasi to paga is also receiving attention and consultants have been engaged to advise government on the best model for the development of the line  mr speaker with reference to the ghana and burkina faso rail interconnectivity the two countries are in earnest discussions as to the realisation of the project there are fortnightly meetings either in accra or ouagadougou and we are confident that deliberations will conclude and actual construction will commence by the third quarter of this year mr speaker i know i am not saying anything new exactly every government has said it and it has been in every plan we have drawn up in this country since independence but the difference this time is that we have started and the dream of a modern railway network in our country will become a reality during the tenure of this administration mr speaker a modern reliable network of roads railways water transport and airports would transform our country and i am delighted to note that fresh enthusiasm has entered the aviation sector under the guidance of the dynamic minister for aviation cecilia abena dapaah to link up all parts of the country by air mr speaker the advance of technology means we can reach people and get a lot done without much physical movement the cyber population that is busy on facebook twitter instagram whatsapp and other social media outlets would testify that ghana is very much part of the virtual world and its activities more and more of us are banking and paying our bills online a wealth of knowledge and information is now available on the net to make teaching and learning easier we are working to make the child that sits in a classroom in zebilla have the same opportunities as the child in a classroom in ridge in accra in their own way these modern communication tools are opening up our country and the world to us all the start of the digital address system the introduction of paperless transactions at our ports the rapid and continuing spread of broadband services are all helping to formalise and modernise our economy thanks to the creative leadership of the intrepid minister for communications hon ursula owusuekuful mp for ablekuma west furthermore subsequent to cabinet approval the framework agreement between ghana and the republic of mauritius for an initial investment in the development of a technology park in dawa in the greater accra region has been ratified by parliament for implementation to begin unfortunately and predictably a whole new set of dangers of cyber insecurity and fraud have emerged with these modern tools we are working to strengthen cyber security to build confidence and protect the use of electronic communications in national development and ensure that our young technologically savvy people would keep ghana firmly in the exciting it economy and its many opportunities  mr speaker we need an educated and skilled workforce to be able to operate the modern economy we are creating the free shs is a start towards this goal it is a policy that has come to stay we are reforming the schools curricula to deal with the weaknesses in our education system and lay greater emphasis on science technology engineering mathematics stem reading history and technical and vocational skills a look at the national budget would tell you we are spending a lot of money on education and i am certain that it is a worthwhile investment being brilliantly supervised by that charismatic minister for education hon dr matthew opoku prempeh member of parliament for manhyia south it is in my view also important that the reform of our schools curricula should instil in our youth respect for the traditional values of discipline fellowfeeling hard work honesty integrity and patriotism without which no healthy social development can occur in much the same way we dare not compromise on the health of the population we have cleared a substantial part of the debts and arrears that were choking the national health insurance scheme courtesy of the prudent management of the able chartered accountant health minister hon kwaku agyemang manu mp for dormaa central this has led to the revival of the nhis and the renewal of respect for the nhis card the health needs of our people are being better served moreover as we work to open up the country i hope that our efforts at improving the conditions of work for health workers would be appreciated and there would no longer be the reluctance to serve in some parts of ghana mr speaker in line with our commitment to building a fair and inclusive society we promised last year to increase the share of the district assemblies common fund to persons with disabilities from  percent to  percent and we delivered effective july last year the policy of ensuring that  of the persons who manage the countrys toll booths are persons with disabilities started nonetheless we are determined to address the other concerns of persons living with disabilities a healthy nation mr speaker is a wellfed nation for generations we have bemoaned ghanas reliance solely on rainfed agriculture this means the slightest change in the rainfall pattern exposed our farmers to the loss of a seasons harvest it is a disgrace that we have had to rely on our sahelian neighbours to make up the deficit in foods such as vegetables this year the onevillageonedam project starts full operation it is a simple lowtech project but these dams will make a big difference to all our lives and the livelihoods of our farmers already many of the little dams that had been abandoned have been rehabilitated and brought back into use a deliberate and specific intervention to help farmers is paying off our farmers can see that the government is putting resources to back up the usual words the  subsidy on fertilizer and the increase in the provision of extension services are making a great difference to the performance of ghanaian agriculture under the planting for food and jobs scheme we are witnessing a fresh interest in farming the success of the first year has encouraged us to increase the scope of the programme and this year some half a million farmers would be signed on up from the figure of two hundred thousand  last year that champion of ghanaian farmers the minister for food and agriculture dr owusu afriyie akoto is doing a yeomans job mr speaker fishing in our country an industry that provides a living for ten percent of the population has been bedeviled by many problems in the past the fishing harvest has gone down dramatically and we have had to depend more and more on imported fish we have started work to tackle these problems this past year we made sure that the close season was respected not just by the industrial tuna vessels but also by the trawlers we will adhere to this policy for the foreseeable future which should help us replenish our depleted stocks more effective measures are being taken against illegal unreported and unregulated methods of fishing we have also instituted measures to avert premix diversions and strict auditing of landing beaches are in place i can state that since november there has been no report of premix diversion a marked improvement from the past mr speaker i believe that the future lies in the promotion of aquaculture and we have set about it with a lot of enthusiasm we have identified  dams in five regions across the country – upper east upper west northern volta and western – and stocked them with fingerlings this is the start of big things to come due to the efforts of the forceful minister for fisheries and aquaculture hon elizabeth afoley quaye mp for krowor mr speaker agriculture forms the backbone of our flagship  programme the majority of the proposals that have been evaluated and accepted for support under the scheme are agrobased it is food processing after all that has been the takeoff point for industrialization in most developed societies it also fits in with our determination to open up our country and make jobs and facilities available in all parts of the country mr speaker problems associated with our environment and the galamsey phenomenon have taken up a lot of the time and energy of this government the fight against galamsey is being spearheaded by a highpowered interministerial committee led by the globallyacclaimed ghanaian scientist prof kwabena frimpong boateng minister for science technology environment and innovation supported by the indefatigable minister for lands and natural resources john peter amewu this committee is waging a valiant struggle to bring the galamsey phenomenon under control its work has received thankfully the wide support of the media mr speaker we have had to ban smallscale mining for the pastnine months we acknowledge that the banning of smallscale mining cannot be the longterm solution in a country such as ours which is blessed with so many minerals but as the saying goes desperate situations call for desperate remedies we cannot look on as our very existence as a country is put in jeopardy and our water bodies forests and land mass are destroyed even with the ban it has been a neverending battle with the galamseyers and i am sure the house will want to join me in paying tribute to the members of our forces in the operation vanguard that are protecting our environment they are ghanaian patriots of the first order we have started various schemes to find sustainable alternative sources of income for the galamsayers mr speaker nothing will ever equate the attraction of the search for gold or diamond and maybe the drama of actually finding some but this generation of ghanaians dares not preside over the destruction of our lands the state of our rivers and forests remains a great cause for worry and it is our sacred duty to protect them i hope i can count on the total support of the house to help nurse our degraded lands and rivers back to health i am equally grateful to those chiefs who have supported the fight against galamsey my government will continue to reach out to our traditional rulers so that together we can address pressing issues facing our nation and its peace and stability mr speaker there is relief in some areas and i refer specifically to the spectacular improvement in our power supply problems a lot of hard work has gone into easing the intolerable debt situation that threatened to paralyse the energy industry we still have problems with the cost of power and we are working to put ghana at a competitive advantage we intend to find private sector operators to buy into the state owned thermal plants and inject the capital needed to bring power tariffs down for both domestic and commercial consumers the most reliable and ultimately cheapest answer to our power needs lies with renewable energy sources we shall promote and enthusiastically encourage investment and use of renewable energy i am sure that the house shares my relief that dumsor is no longer part of our everyday lexicon long may it stay so as we applaud the efforts of the tireless minister energy minister boakye agyarko mr speaker the safety and security of our people are at the heart of all that we do ghanaian citizens have a right to expect to go about their daily lives in an atmosphere of peace a ghanaian has a right to expect that those who break the law must be subjected to the sanctions laid down under the law the police the prosecution services and the judiciary owe it to all of us to make us feel and be safe i do not need to repeat that crime wears no political colours and i am certain that message has gone down to all mr speaker the law enforcement agencies will crack down very hard on all those who would disturb the peace of our nation we will give the police the resources they need to do their job an initial amount of gh¢ million is being made available to procure and supply within the next six months critical modern policing equipment and gadgets to enhance the capacity of the police to enforce law and order including one thousand  vehicles motorbikes and ammunition the equipment is to facilitate visibility mobility and improved responsiveness of the police to ensure a safe secure and peaceful economic and social environment for ghanaians to work and thrive already the successful renegotiation of existing contracts has enabled us purchase forthwith  vehicles for the police in the medium to longterm we will purchase drones and helicopters to assist the police combat violent and environmental crime the crime laboratories will be modernised and properly equipped to provide the necessary support the police intelligence unit will also be strengthened the perennial problems associated with police accommodation will be tackled and a compensation package introduced to cover officers in their line of duty  mr speaker i am aware that the entire nation is extremely anxious and perturbed by the activities of the migrant nomadic herdsmen in the country we are rehabilitating the kraals or ranches that were abandoned after the kufuorled npp government left office in  they will become operational shortly to provide secure grazing places for cattle at the same time efforts are also being intensified to find an ecowaswide solution to an issue which goes beyond the boundaries of our country and is affecting the entire west african region mr speaker we shall not allow miscreants of any sort to terrorize our population and i promise that there will be no hiding place for criminals i am certain that the interventions we are introducing will boost morale in the service and i urge the house and all citizens to support the police to deliver the service we deserve the formidable minister for the interior hon ambrose dery mp for nandom needs our effective cooperation to carry out his allimportant functions in much the same way we are beginning to address the problems of our armed forces i am happy to report that work has started on the barracks regeneration programme the acute accommodation problems that face our armed forces must be and are now being tackled by that energetic minister for defence hon dominic nitiwul mp for bimbilla we know that it is in all our interests that those charged with ensuring our security and who put their lives on the line for our safety are able to concentrate on their jobs without distractions like inadequate and inappropriate housing it is vital that all of us give maximum support to the noble and brave men and women of our security services involved in operation calm life operation vanguard and operation cow leg aimed at guaranteeing the safety of our people the integrity of our environment and the peace of our nation mr speaker the housing deficit is not limited to our security services it is a nationwide problem that is caused mostly by the intolerable pressure on land prices this has put affordable housing out of the reach of most people we have begun the difficult process of making housing affordable for ghanaians government last year abolished the  vatnhil on real estate sales and continues to create a conducive environment that is reducing interest rates on mortgage loans discussions are also ongoing between the pensions regulatory authority and the banks to underwrite an effective mortgage system this will facilitate access to housing for the ordinary budget government will also continue to create the enabling environment that will promote private sector investment in cheaper housing for the people  mr speaker i am sure no one needs reminding in this house that i have signed into law the office of special prosecutor act an essential step in our overall strategy to combat corruption i look forward to the house dealing speedily with the process of confirmation of the nominee a person of proven professional ability with an established record of integrity and independence of character here again we are in unchartered waters but i am convinced that there is enough goodwill in the country to propel the first occupant of this position into setting a good and firm foundation for the position of the special prosecutor mr speaker year in year out the nations auditorgeneral produces a report on our public finances it is often full of grand cases of corruption in our public services the auditorgenerals report on mda liabilities as at december  makes truly alarming reading i make reference to the fact that a staggering amount of gh¢ billion has been identified as constituting fictitious claims in the course of this address mr speaker the house has heard me struggle to identify a source of funding to build our roads every day we hear reports on our radios and televisions of dilapidated classrooms and children who sit on floors at school just think of the difference that gh¢ billion would make to the nations finances that would certainly be enough to build and furnish hundreds of classrooms and construct the eastern corridor roads every citizen is affected by acts of corruption and we should all work to tackle them government has an obligation to treat the auditorgenerals report seriously and to work to retrieve illegally acquired monies from those who would impoverish us all the role of occupyghana in increasing awareness of the importance of the work of the auditorgeneral should be recognised mr speaker the preamble to the constitution of the republic enjoins each one of us to uphold the principles of freedom and justice probity and accountability in furtherance of these principles i have made it publicly known that anyone who has information about acts of corruption by any of my appointees should bring it forward and should be prepared to back it up with evidence for i will have it investigated so far every single alleged act of corruption levelled against any of my appointees has been investigated by independent bodies and in some cases by parliament itself and the findings made public from the allegations against the ministerdesignate for energy at his parliamentary confirmation hearings to that against the ceo of bost to those against the two deputy chiefs of staff to the conflict of interest allegations against the minister for finance and most recently to the claims of extortion against the trade and industry minister – they have all been investigated and no evidence has been adduced to suggest any act of corruption conflict of interest or wrongdoing it appears however that some are determined to stick to their politicallymotivated view that there has been corruption this surely is not helpful it is important to note that in my first year of office despite having a clear parliamentary majority two separate bipartisan probes in parliament have been established to inquire into allegations of corruption as against zero in recent years notwithstanding the persistent calls by the then minority over several allegations mr speaker with the greatest of respect and in the words of the articulate minister for information mustapha abdulhamid no matter how long a log stays under water it will never become a crocodile mr speaker there was great relief around the country when the international tribunal for the law of the sea found in our favour in the maritime boundary dispute with cote divoire a dispute which was litigated by successive governments in the national interest the last lap being run by the able attorney general ms gloria akuffo in our celebrations we did not forget that good neighbourliness is the hallmark of our foreign policy and i am glad to state that our good relations with cote divoire have not been affected in any way by the resolution of the dispute indeed cote divoires renowned president his excellency m alassane ouattara at my invitation paid us a memorable official visit after the ruling to underline his countrys determination to maintain if not deepen its good relations with our own in fact as you may remember he and i signed on that occasion laccord strategique de parteniariat a strategic partnership agreement for those who find french difficult to emphasise the enhanced relationship we both seek for our two neighbouring countries another obvious immediate benefit from the sensible reaction of both sides to the outcome of the dispute is the subsequent agreement by exxonmobil the worlds largest publicly traded oil and gas company to explore and develop with us potentially rich oil blocks that were affected by the dispute  mr speaker much as we all recognise the importance of exploiting the offshore hydrocarbon resources of our nation i think it equally critical for us not to ignore the possibilities of our onshore deposits especially in the voltaian basin so last year i directed our stateowned oil development company the ghana national petroleum corporation gnpc to pay particular attention to this potential it is good to hear that that directive appears to be yielding dividends as gnpc from the results of its pilot survey in the voltaian basin has established the presence of a working petroleum system i hope that eventually there will be something big for us to cheer about mr speaker this year we will continue the process of passing the legislative instruments of the national youth and sports act pursue the enactment of the draft national sports college bill and create a sports fund to improve sports development in the country government also remains committed to the development of football in the country we have begun the rehabilitation of the accra sports stadium aka ohene djan sports stadium and in partnership with the inner city and zongo development ministry and the ghana football association we are constructing a number of football pitches in the zongos and across the rest of the country to aid in the revival of colts football which has been responsible for the production of talents like abedi pele and tony yeboah we need to catch the talents at a young age if ghanaian football is to continue with its traditions of excellence and perform well on the national and international stage mr speaker we in ghana are proud members of regional continental and global communities since my inauguration i have been active with the help of the eloquent foreign minister hon shirley ayorkor botchway mp for anyaa sowutuom in keeping up and promoting the historical role of ghana within these communities a role of independent sovereign action in the supreme interest of the ghanaian and african peoples i have travelled around our neighbourhood and beyond and i am glad to report that the black star is shiningit is the reason for the unprecedented numbers of world leaders – african asian and european – who have thronged our shores this past year and enjoyed our renowned ghanaian hospitality it explains also the warmth with which i am greeted wherever i go in the world  mr speaker a countrys image turns on the most unlikely things and events it could be because of the exploits of a football team like brazil it could be because of the exploits of one athlete like frankie fredericks for namibia or maria mutola for mozambique it could be because of a highlife connoisseur like et mensah for ghana a singertrumpeter like hugh masekela for south africa the image of a country can be made forever because of a william shakespeare or an anton chekov or a chinua achebe or an ayi kwei amarh the image could hinge simply on a mona lisa painting or a david adjayes inspired structure i am therefore very much aware that we have to create the space and atmosphere for our artists and creatives and we shall support them the foundations for the passing of the creative arts bill have been laid and ultimately processes for the setting up of the creative arts fund will be completed to enable our creative artists to access funds to boost their art mr speaker as we make progress in our undertakings more and more people will come to ghana to find things out for themselves to conduct business and increasingly simply as tourists to experience our country and enjoy themselves i am happy to report that we have now recognized the need to go further than our reputation for being hospitable we are building a ghana where tourists will feel at home and we shall feel proud when they say i was in ghana on december   i joined the chiefs and people of osu and gbese to cut the sod for the  accra marine drive project this project during construction and upon completion will generate thousands of jobs for the local community and across the value chain and position ghana as a key tourism destination mr speaker i have an apology to make to the house i promised last year we would endeavour to pass into law the affirmative action bill this did not happen my commitment to the promotion of the advancement of women is without question women constitute the majority of the population and our success or otherwise as a nation will be measured by how well women are doing the bill will definitely come to parliament this session in the meantime i have thrown my full weight behind the heforshe campaign and the gender and development initiative for africa gadia an initiative stemming from my position as the african unions gender champion i urge all ghanaian males to join together in giving ghanaian females the dignity they deserve as tenaciously promoted by the polyglot minister for gender children and social protection otiko afisa djaba i further entreat all of us male and female to support the implementation of the  united nations sustainable development goals which have been incorporated into governments coordinated programme of economic and social

      "published on by the president of the republic of ghana he nana addo dankwa akufoaddo delivered ghanas  anniversary speech at the black stars square today he president of the federal republic of nigeria muhammadu buhari was the special guest of honour the following is the full speech delivered by the president speech by the president of the republic nana addo dankwa akufoaddo on the occasion of ghanas  independence day celebration at the independnece square on tuesday  march  it is sixtyone years now since our nation ghana won her independenceat its birth great things were expected of this nation of ours and even greater things were expected of those who would have the honour to be called ghanaians this is the country after all that blazed the trail for independence on the african continent and with it came a grave responsibility to be forever used as a measure of how the continent was doing today it is ghanas kente that identifies the african continent and its peoples in many ways we rose to the occasion the many and varied peoples that came together through happenstance or deliberate actions to form the modern state of ghana have crafted a common identitywe might be dagartis sissalas dagombas mamprusis gonjas konkombas frafras grusis kusasis gas krobos ewes fantes denkyiras gomoas guans nzemas ahantas sefwis akyems akwamus akuapems kwahus brongs or ashantis we might sometimes even lapse into ancient rivalry modes but as ghanaians we are comfortable in our skin apart from the physical outward things that identify us there are the more subtle but important things that define us as ghanaians we are a hospitable people we make strangers and visitors feel at home it is part of our dna we ghanaians look out for each other and especially so when we find ourselves outside our country we still regard the upbringing and training of children as a group responsibility for the public good and the most sophisticated amongst us is not embarrassed to show respect to the elderly we might have become famous or infamous for being great travellers who can be found in all parts of the globe but i can safely say that deep inside us we love our country we love ghana we take seriously the words of our national motto and have a passionate love for freedom and justice on a day such as today our thoughts invariably stray to the past but we do not intend to live on past memories to paraphrase ephraim amu in yen araasaaseni it is now our turn to build upon those past glories adu me ne wonso so seyebeye bi atoa so the litmus test is simple every day must bring some improvement in our lives today must be an improvement on yesterday and our tomorrow must certainly be better than our yesterday even though underachievement may have been a major part of our history thus far it should no longer be part of our destiny the only nation we are destined to become is the one we choose and decide to be we do not have to accept someones definition of africa or of ghana we must define and craft our destiny but achieving our destiny requires a deliberate qualitative change in all aspects of our lives especially in the structure of our economy the state of our infrastructure the education of our young people and acquisition of skills and above all in our attitudes and the holding firm to the values that define us the change in our fortunes will only happen when our economies improve since i became president i have been advocating for a ghana indeed an africa beyond aid and i am keen to have the support of all of us in this enterprise nobody needs to spell it out to us that the economic transformation we aspire to will not come through aid we have been on this trajectory for sixty years and it has not happened aid was never meant to be what would bring us to a developed nation status my fellow ghanaians ours is a country that is well endowed with many natural resources such as gold bauxite diamonds oil timber cocoa water fertile land etc the truth however is that the state of our nation does not bear out that we have these natural endowments poverty continues to be our lot we have huge infrastructural deficits mismanagement corruption and high fiscal deficits have become the hallmarks of our economy which we finance through borrowing and foreign aid it is time to pursue a path to prosperity and selfrespect for our nation a ghana beyond aid is a prosperous and selfconfident ghana that is in charge of its economic destiny ghana beyond aid is not a pie in the sky notion other countries including some of our peers at independence have done exactly that it is doable and we must believe that what others with less resources have done we can do however we are not going to achieve the transformation in our economy which is necessary for a ghana beyond aid by just talking about it we have to do something about it as a start we have to do things differently business as usual will not do it it cannot happen by waving a magic wand and it cannot be achieved overnight indeed the most rapid cases of economic and social transformation in history those in south east asia generally spanned a period of about  years about a generation we cannot wait that long we have wasted enough time already we have to hurry but we must be realistic to get to a ghana beyond aid we will have to effectively harness our own resources and creatively and efficiently deploy them for rapid economic and social transformation this will require hard work enterprise creativity and a consistent fight against corruption in public life it will also require that we break from a mentality of dependency and adopt a confident cando spirit fuelled by love for our dear country ghana we cannot subordinate the common good to build a prosperous nation to the selfish interest of a few fellow ghanaians we have started on the right path with the concrete steps we are taking to restore macroeconomic stability and economic growth after a year of disciplined and innovative economic management the results have been remarkable fiscal discipline has been restored and fiscal consolidation has taken hold for the first time since  the government of ghana has been able to meet its fiscal deficit target we will continue to manage the economy in a disciplined and sound framework so that we maintain fiscal and debt sustainability this in the long run is fundamental to moving beyond aid fellow ghanaians corruption or more specifically the stealing of public funds continues to hold back the development of our nation corruption is not a partisan matter and we must all act to protect the public purse with the office of the special prosecutor now in place we can expect more prosecutions for corruption in the coming months and public officials present and past should be on notice that they would be held accountable for their actions there is however one piece of the anticorruption framework that is yet to be put in place the right to information act it would increase transparency and add another critical weapon to the armoury in the fight against corruption after many years of hesitation we intend to bring a bill again to parliament and work to get it passed into law before parliament rises the protection of the public purse is a social common good and it depends on all of us it is in all our interest that corruption does not thrive and we police each others behaviour going beyond aid means ghanaians should not serve as fronts for foreign companies to defraud our country it will mean we all pay our taxes and it will mean we all help to take care of government property as though it were our own adding value to our raw materials is also key to industrialization prosperity and jobs it is unacceptable that even though we produce in west africa  of cocoa beans in the world we earn only between  and  of the final price of a chocolate bar value addition is therefore imperative if we are to maximize the potential to pursue resourcebased industrializationfellow ghanaians we now live in a digital world and to be competitive we have to be a part of and take advantage of digitization since assuming office last year we have undertaken deliberate policy reforms to digitize ghana to formalize our economy the national identification and address system the drivers licence and vehicle registration the paperless operation at the ports interoperability of payment system in the financial sector are all geared towards modernizing our economy and we should begin to feel the difference when all these measures become operational later this year i am looking forward particularly to the digitization of the land registration process to help the mortgage market and help release hundreds of billions of cedis to finance our development fellow ghanaians at its core the poverty gap is a technology gap the mastery of technology is what at the end of the day separates developed from developing countries or rich from poor countries this is a gap we have to bridge we are laying a strong foundation for an educated and skilled workforce of the future through the free senior high school shs program which this academic year enabled  additional young ghanaians to enroll in shs these are our future scientists engineers modern farmers innovators entrepreneurs and transformation agents fellow ghanaians as government committed to the growth of the private sector we believe that the private sector should be the critical partner in moving ghana beyond aid in truth part of our problem has been that government tries to do too much tries to take on far too much beyond its capacity there are many projects in roads railways water transport agriculture etc which if properly structured will attract private sector financing key to attracting private sector investment is a conducive business friendly and peaceful environment my dear fellow ghanaians all these plans and big dreams i have outlined will come to naught if we do not have peace in our country the primary requirement for prosperity is peace the first obligation on any government is to ensure the safety of the citizens as your president this is an obligation i accept and i am determined to discharge faithfully the recent spate of armed robbery incidents is totally unacceptable i will work to ensure that citizens are able to go about their daily duties in the confidence that they are safe i want to make this clear no miscreant will have the space to terrorize citizens and generate a sense of insecurity in our country the police have the primary responsibility of maintaining peace and keeping law and order in our society and in exceptional cases with the backing of the armed forces the government is doing and will do whatever it takes to enable the police discharge their duties effectively we are providing the means for them to modernize their equipment and learn modern methods of policing and the numbers will be rapidly increased to match our growing population and sophistication and audacity of the criminals we should not forget that the police need the help and support of the community to be able to do their work we dare not lose our reputation as a haven of peace and security i urge you all to join in making sure there is no hiding place in our midst for those who would disturb our peace for my part i will do whatever is necessary within the confines of the constitution and the laws of the land to ensure the peace of our country fellow ghanaians ghana beyond aid is meant to be more than a slogan it is meant to propel us into the frame of mind that would quicken our pace of development it is meant to change our mindset from one of dependency to one of achieving our destiny it is meant to put us in charge of our own affairs and make us truly independent above all ghana beyond aid will give us the respect and dignity we deserve let us believe in ourselves let us believe in ghana and

      "it is sixtyone years today since our nation ghana won her independence and it is fitting that we should gather to celebrate the anniversary of this special day i extend on behalf of all ghanaians a warm welcome to our guest of honour that sterling champion of the battle against one of africas most pernicious diseases corruption in public life muhammadu buhari president of the great federal republic of nigeria and his delegation we are delighted that he has accepted our invitation to share this special day with usnigeria oman panyin muhammadu buhari yɛ ma wo ni wo ahokafuor akwaaba surunkosanda zua muhammadu buhari shuugaban kasa nigeria da mutaanin ka last year at the independence anniversary i announced that on my way here i had cut the sod for the construction of a national cathedral which would serve as an interdenominational place of worship for important national occasions this year i am happy to announce that on my way here i have unveiled the beautiful design of the cathedral that has been done by the worldacclaimed ghanaian architect david adjaye god will see the project through for us at its birth great things were expected of this nation of ours and even greater things were expected of those who would have the honour to be called ghanaians this is the country after all that blazed the trail for independence on the african continent and with it came a grave responsibility to be forever used as a measure of how the continent was doing in many ways we rose to the occasion the many and varied peoples that came together through happenstance

denkyiras gomoas guans nzemas ahantas sefwis akyems akwamus akuapems kwahus brongs or ashantis we might sometimes even lapse into ancient rivalry modes but as ghanaians we are comfortable in our skin this sense of identity shows in our clothes in our foods in our music and in our politics sixty one years after this nation pledged itself to the total liberation of the continent in the immemorial words of our first leader kwame nkrumah on that unforgettable night of march  at the old polo grounds a few hundred yards from here that our independence is meaningless unless it is linked up with the total liberation of africa we have remained faithful to our panafrican vocation we know that our struggle for economic growth and independence cannot be for our nation alone but for the entire african continent a few weeks ago in the hallowed halls of the united states congress as their president came to deliver the state of the union address a group of congressmen and women wanted to make a statement of support for african nations they draped kente strips over their clothing and that said it all ghanas kente has come to identify the african continent and its peoples the kente best spells out the fact that we are a dynamic people unafraid to put our best foot forward and unafraid constantly to adapt our cultures and traditions we wear it with pride and in style that quintessential ghanaian patriot scholar and cultural icon ephraim amu would certainly be looking on now with admiration and satisfaction at least as far as clothing is concerned we seem to have accepted his admonitions to be selfreliant and to take pride in what was ours rather than copy others during his time owura amu fought a lonely battle but today it seems strange to us that anyone ever suggested that you had to be dressed in europeanstyle clothes to be accepted as a scholar or even to show up in church apart from the physical outward things that identify us there are the more subtle but important things that define us as ghanaians everybodys list will doubtless be different let me cite a few of my favourite ones we are a hospitable people we make strangers and visitors feel at home it is part of our dna we ghanaians look out for each other even in modern chaotic urban settings and even when we find ourselves outside our country we still regard the upbringing and training of children as a group responsibility for the public good and the most sophisticated amongst us is not embarrassed to show respect to the elderly we might have become famous or infamous for being great travellers who can be found in all parts of the globe but i can safely say that deep inside us we love our country we love ghana we take seriously the words of our national motto and have a passionate love for freedom and justice fellow ghanaians there is a long list of honoured personalities that have played remarkable roles in getting ghana to where she is today many of them have been publicly acknowledged and justifiably honoured in various ways the role of the big six – joseph boakye danquah emmanuel obetsebi lamptey edward akufoaddo william oforiatta ebenezer ako adjei and kwame nkrumah our first president who led us to independence – in the struggle for and attainment of independence will never be forgotten there are others such as george paa grant komla agbeli gbedema and kojo botsio whose efforts deserve to be acknowledged and we should continue to give honour where it is due but i must also pay homage to the many ghanaians who simply continue to do their jobs and execute their tasks competently without any fuss they do not ask to be recognised or recompensed in any way for as the prime minister of the erstwhile progress party government of the republic kofi abrefa busia put it and i quote it is by the devoted daytoday service of many ordinary and unnoticed citizens that a nation achieves greatness i pay homage to the many millions who routinely do what is right what is virtuous in their daily activities to elevate the common good and do not come to the attention of a president on a day such as this when we celebrate the official start of our nationhood we should also pay homage to those who have led the fight for individual freedoms the fight that has made it possible for the present generation to believe that multiparty constitutional form of government is part of our makeup the fight that led to the changing of the words of our national anthem in  to include the sacred injunction to help us to resist oppressors rule i pay homage to all those who have led the fight to resist oppressors rule every time attempts have been made to take our freedoms from us i salute also those who insisted that the concepts of probity and accountability should be part of the governing principles of the constitution of the republic whose silver jubilee we celebrated on january by an interfaith service of thanksgiving to almighty god for having ushered us into the longest uninterrupted period of stable constitutional governance in our history fellow ghanaians it is important that we never forget our history and we try not to distort the truth about our past the ugly and beautiful parts they all deserve to be faithfully recorded and told as our elders say if you do not know where you are coming from you are not likely to get to where you want to be our brothers and sisters in nigeria probably capture it best to forget is the same as to throw away we should make an honest assessment of ourselves and the situation of our country and our continent this puts a lot of responsibility on those who tell our daily stories in these days of social media the task is on all of us and not only on the journalists and writers a deliberate falsehood posted on a social media platform poses a great danger to all of us and undermines the credibility of the ghana story on a day such as today our thoughts invariably stray to the past but as the president of the republic his excellency john agyekum kufuor once put it and i quote we do not intend to live on past memories nor the ghana story to be only what can be seen on old newsreel tapes nor our sporting glories to be recounted only through the exploits of past heroes to paraphrase ephraim amu in that great patriotic songyen ara yen asaaseni it is now our turn to build upon those past glories –aduru me ne wonso so seyebeye bi atoa so the litmus test is simple every day must bring some improvement in our lives today must be an improvement on yesterday and our tomorrow must certainly be better than our yesterday fellow ghanaians on this our sixtyfirst anniversary of our independence it is important to remind ourselves that around the time of our independence we had peers such as malaysia south korea and singapore our per capita incomes were very similar at around four hundred and fifty united states dollars  in  and our economies were dependent on the production of primary commodities today these countries once our peers have significantly transformed themselves into industrialised economies income per head in singapore is now at fifty one thousand four hundred and thirty one united states dollars  south korea at twenty nine thousand one hundred and fifteen united states dollars  and malaysia at nine thousand six hundred and twenty three united states dollars  compared to ghanas at one thousand one hundred and fifty two united states dollars  we are still dependent on the export of primary commodities as was the case at the time of gordon guggisberg we must admit sadly that in the area of economic development we have underachieved relative to our peers at independence even though underachievement may have been a major part of our history thus far it should no longer be part of our destiny the only nation we are destined to become is the one we choose and decide to be we do not have to accept someones definition of africa or ghana we must define and craft our own destiny as the american politician william jennings bryan once put it and i quote destiny is not a matter of choice it is not a thing to be waited for it is a thing to be achieved but achieving our destiny requires a deliberate qualitative change in all aspects of our lives especially in the structure of our economy the nature of our infrastructure the education of our young people and acquisition of skills and above all in our attitudes and holding firm to the values that define us the change in our fortunes will only happen when our economy improves since i became president i have been advocating for a ghana indeed an africa beyond aid and i am keen to have the support of all of us in this enterprise nobody needs to spell it out to us that the economic transformation we desire will not come through aid we have been on that trajectory for most of the past sixty one years and it has not happened we are told there is aid fatigue the taxpayers of the aidgivers have a right to decide how their tax money is spent the truth is that even if there were no aid fatigue and with the best will in the world and the most charitable governments in place in the socalled donor countries there will never be enough aid to develop ghana to the level we want aid was never meant to be what would bring us to the status of a developed nation i do not by advocating a status beyond aid want to inflict poverty on us or thumb our noses against those who have helped us and continue to do so there is nothing to be gained in celebrating an ideological victory in poverty there is no pride or dignity in poverty there is no dignity in having hungry children or mothers dying needlessly in childbirth and there is no dignity in drinking dirty water we need no lessons in that my fellow ghanaians ours is a country that is well endowed with many natural resources such as gold bauxite iron ore diamonds oil natural gas timber cocoa water fertile land etc the truth however is that the state of our nation does not bear out that we have these natural endowments poverty continues to be our lot mismanagement corruption and high fiscal deficits have become the hallmarks of our economy which we finance through borrowing and foreign aid it is time to pursue a path to prosperity and selfrespect for our nation aghana beyond aidis a prosperous and selfconfident ghana that is in charge of her economic destiny a transformed ghana that is prosperous enough to be beyond needing aid and that engages competitively with the rest of the world through trade and investment it is possible it is not a pie in the sky notion because other countries including some of our peers at independence have done exactly that it is doable and we must believe that what others with less resources have done we can do however we are not going to achieve the transformation in our economy which is necessary for a ghana beyond aid by just talking about it we have to do something about it as a start we have to do things differently to realize this goal of a ghana beyond aid business as usual will not do it it cannot happen by waving a magic wand and it cannot be achieved overnight indeed the most rapid cases of economic and social transformation in history those in south east asia generally spanned a period of about  years about a generation we cannot wait that long we have wasted enough time already it is time to get on with it and the time is now  you have heard me say on a number of occasions i am a man in a hurry but i am also a realistic man  to get to a ghana beyond aid we will have to harness effectively our own resources and deploy them creatively and efficiently for rapid economic and social transformation as i said in the independence day address last year this will require hard work enterprise creativity and a consistent fight against corruption in public life it will also require that we break from a mentality of dependency and adopt a confident cando spirit fuelled by love for our dear country ghana we cannot subordinate the common good to build a prosperous nation to the selfish interest of a few moving ghana beyond aid means ensuring that future generations of ghanaians have a healthy environment to inherit we must thus be determined to protect our environment and water bodies by joining hands in the fight against illegal mining also known as galamsey in order to bring an end to the devastation of some of our landscape and the pollution of our water bodies occasioned by the activities of illegal miners we have to win that fight to keep our environment clean and protect our heritage for our descendants fellow ghanaians we have started on the right path towards a prosperous future with the concrete steps we are taking to restore macroeconomic stability and economic growth after a year of disciplined and innovative economic management the results have been remarkable our economy has grown from  in  the lowest in  years to  in  and is this year expected to grow at  which would make it the fastest growing economy in the world inflation has gone down from  at the end of  to  as of january this year ghanaian industry has witnessed a spectacular revival from a growth rate of negative  in  to  in  interest rates are on the decline the cedi is stabilising and the fiscal deficit has gone down from  in  to  of gdp in  with a projection of  for  fiscal discipline has been restored and fiscal consolidation has taken hold for the first time since  government has been able to meet its fiscal deficit target we will continue to manage the economy in a disciplined and sound framework so that we maintain fiscal and debt sustainability this in the long run is fundamental to moving beyond aid an improving disciplined macroeconomy is essential for expanding the economy and thereby creating jobs this year we will see vigorous job creation in the public sector beginning with the recruitment of one hundred thousand  young men and women in the nation builders corp but what i am seeking above all is the rapid growth of private sector jobs both in industry and agriculture ie in the programme for planting for food and jobs which should generate a lot of rural sector jobs moving beyond aid demands that effective measures are taken to address widespread unemployment especially amongst our youth we are on the right path to do so fellow ghanaians corruption or more specifically the stealing of public funds continues to hold back the development of our nation a recent audit by the auditor general into the liabilities of the ministries departments and agencies led to the disallowance of some gh¢ billion of claims these are fictitious claims that would otherwise have had to be paid but for the eagle eye of the auditor general can you imagine what we can do with gh¢ billion it can certainly finance the free shs for five years corruption is not a partisan matter and we must all act to protect the public purse in the words of the president of the republic his excellency jerry john rawlings and i quote combating corruption is not beyond us imagine the effect on our nation and our future if for just a few months all decent ghanaians would put aside their own convenience apathy and faintheartedness and challenge every corruption no matter how petty which comes their way with the office of the special prosecutor now in place we can expect more prosecutions for corruption in the coming months and public officials present and past should be on notice that they would be held accountable for their stewardship of our public finances government has also made in  significant savings of some gh¢ million in government procurement as we depart from sole sourcing as the primary method of public procurement that departure will strengthen our public finances and make it possible for us to finance our development ourselves there is however one piece of the anticorruption framework that is yet to be put in place the right to information bill it would increase transparency and add another critical weapon to the armoury in the fight against corruption after many years of hesitation we intend to bring a bill again to parliament and work to get it passed into law before the end of this meeting of parliament  the protection of the public purse is a social common good and it depends on all of us it is in all our interest that corruption does not thrive and we police each others behaviour going beyond aid means ghanaians should not serve as fronts for foreign companies to defraud our country it will mean we all pay our taxes as provided by law and it will mean we all help to take care of government property as though it were our own  fellow ghanaians getting our country to a situation beyond aid means we add value to our exports and stop the export of materials such as cocoa gold bauxite manganese and oil in their raw state our cocoa farmers for example get less than  of the value of a bar of chocolate and yet cocoa is the main ingredient on the world market bauxite in its raw form is worth about  per metric tonne processing it just one stage further into alumina oxide will fetch twice that amount refining the alumina oxide into alumina will increase the value by seven times and smeltered aluminium fetches one hundred fold what it gets in the raw state aluminium we are told is the metal of the future it is for this reason that ghana has since independence sought to establish an integrated bauxite and aluminium industry thus far this has remained a fond hope but we are determined to make it happen within the next three years work on the law establishing an integrated bauxite and aluminium development authority is far advanced and will be submitted to parliament very shortly government also hopes to reach an agreement soon with potential partners to establish an alumina refinery and expand the valco smelter a successful execution of this project will be key in moving ghana beyond aid as will be the successful exploitation of our iron ore and manganese deposits to build a steel industry for our country and the region we are all aware of the vast sums of illicit financial flows from our continent that attend the exploitation of our natural resources especially of our mineral wealth we can no longer continue to blame others for that we have to take our destiny into our own hands and design and carry out the appropriate policies and measures that will ensure that we get our fair and proper share of the value of that wealth government will be rolling out such policies as an integral part of our determination to move ghana beyond aid  fellow ghanaians we have huge infrastructure needs in the areas of roads bridges water electricity housing hospitals schools etc the problem has always been where to find the money however where there is a will there is a way my government is going to implement an alternative financing model to leverage our bauxite reserves in particular to finance a major infrastructure programme across ghana this will probably be the largest infrastructure programme in ghanas history without any addition to ghanas debt stock it will involve the barter or exchange of refined bauxite for infrastructure we expect to conclude this agreement and start its implementation this year this will represent a paradigm shift in the financing of our development priorities and make it possible for ghana to move beyond aid ladies and gentlemen we now live in a digital world and to be competitive we have to be a part of and take advantage of digitization since assuming office last year we have undertaken deliberate policy reforms to digitize ghana to formalize our economy and leapfrog in some key areas the national identification and address system the drivers licence and vehicle registration the paperless operation at the ports interoperability of payment system in the financial sector are all geared towards modernizing our economy and we should begin to feel the difference when all these measures become operational this year i am looking forward particularly to the digitization of the land registration process to help the mortgage market and release hundreds of billions of cedis to finance our development digitization would also allow the delivery of education and health services to remote areas reduce corruption expand the tax base expand ecommerce make credit more available as uncertainty is reduced for financial institutions and increase domestic resource mobilization fellow ghanaians at its core the poverty gap is a technology gap the mastery of technology is what at the end of the day separates developed from developing countries or rich from poor countries this is a gap we have to bridge we are laying a strong foundation for an educated and skilled workforce of the future through the free senior high school shs programme which this academic year enabled  additional young ghanaians to enrol in shs these are our future scientists engineers modern farmers innovators entrepreneurs and transformation agents in the years ahead the principal thrust of national development policy must be to ensure that science technology and innovation drive all sectors of the economy we are going to commit resources to basic and applied science and engineering that should result in the development of the capacity to manufacture machinery equipment and component parts for industry agriculture especially machinery for planting harvesting and processing of produce fellow ghanaians as a government committed to the growth of the private sector we believe that the private sector should be the critical partner in moving ghana beyond aid in truth part of our problem has been that government tries to do too much tries to take on far too much beyond its capacity there are many projects in roads railways water transport agriculture etc which if properly structured will attract private sector financing key to attracting private sector investment is a conducive business friendly and peaceful environment my dear fellow ghanaians all these plans and big dreams i have outlined will come to naught if we do not have peace in our country the primary requirement for prosperity is peace the first obligation on any government is to ensure the safety and security of the citizenry as your president this is an obligation i accept and i am determined to discharge faithfully the recent spate of armed robberies is totally unacceptable i will work to ensure that citizens are able to go about their daily duties in the confidence that they are safe no miscreant will have the space to terrorize citizens and generate a sense of insecurity in our country the police have the primary responsibility of maintaining peace and keeping law and order in our society and in exceptional cases with the backing of the armed forces the government is doing and will do whatever it takes to enable the police discharge their duties effectively we are providing the means for them to modernize their equipment and learn modern methods of policing and their numbers will be rapidly increased to match our growing population and the sophistication and audacity of the criminals we should not forget that the police need the help and support of the community to be able to do their work we dare not lose our reputation as a haven of peace and security i urge you all to join in making sure there is no hiding place in our midst for those who would disturb our peace for my part i will do whatever is necessary within the confines of the constitution and the laws of the land to ensure the peace of our country let us on this joyous occasion salute the leadership and the gallant men and women of our security forces who in the various operations calm life cow leg and vanguard are putting their lives on the line to protect our environment and guarantee our safety and security they are patriots indeed  fellow ghanaians ghana beyond aid is meant to be more than a slogan it is meant to propel us into the frame of mind that would quicken our pace of development it is meant to change our mindset from one of dependency to one of achieving our destiny it is meant to put us in charge of our own affairs and make us truly independent above all ghana beyond aid will give us the respect and dignity we deserve let us believe in ourselves let us believe in ghana and in africa god bless us all god bless mother africa and god bless our homeland ghana and make her great and strong thank you for your attention  ghana is a west african country bound on the north by burkina faso on the east by togo on the south by the atlantic oceanand

      " i thank the leadership of organised labour very much for the invitation to be here with you as we mark the day set aside to celebrate workers around the world permit me to begin on a personal note i am exceptionally touched that this second may day celebration of my presidency should take place in this stadium which is named after one of the greatest ghanaians and most talented footballers our nation has produced – baba yara i had the privilege of knowing him in my youth when i was a young republikan at the great club real republikans which was organised by that remarkable director of sports the late ohene djan baba was the star of the club and all of us youngsters young republikans had the great fortune of being able to train with him he favoured me with his friendship and i continued to visit him in his home at independence avenue in accra after the tragic accident which cut short his brilliant career kumasi asante kotoko has produced two of ghanas true footballing greats – him and the lately deceased james adjei may their souls rest in perfect peace in the bosom of the almighty amen as cochair of the group of advocates of eminent persons of the united nations sustainable development goals i am particularly pleased that the tuc has chosen as the theme of this years celebration sustainable development goals and decent work the role of social partners the adoption of the sdgs has presented our generation with a historic opportunity to eradicate global poverty and hunger address the challenges of environmental sustainability achieve quantum leaps in the economic wellbeing of millions of people and ensure that no one is in fact left behind we in ghana can be justifiably proud of having taken up the challenge of the sdgs all the goals have been captured in our coordinated programme for economic and social development policies which in accordance with the dictates of article  of the constitution i submitted to parliament last year on november and recently outdoored on april  if the sdgs are to be successfully implemented every citizen must get involved in the programme i am glad that organised labour sees the sdgs and their implementation as its business and is ready to play its role as a social partner government is also doing its bit on september  i inaugurated a  interministerial committee on the sdgs which has been working to ensure that ghana effectively implements the sdgs chairperson secretary general workers of ghana in the  months that it has been my privilege to be president of our country on most days one subject features prominently in all that i do i suspect there is no prize for guessing that subject is jobs on the day that we celebrate workers jobs must necessarily take centre stage in all our discussions on may day last year the first of my tenure of office i reiterated my conviction that even though i had discovered much to my discomfort that i had become chief employer the private sector was best placed to create long term sustainable jobs given the right atmosphere our belief in the capacity of the private sector does not of course suggest that government would be a helpless bystander that would simply look on in hope government therefore set about the task of putting in place the fundamentals that promote the enabling atmosphere for our entrepreneurs to thrive and create jobs it has taken a lot of hard work and strong nerves to stay on the straight and narrow path to get the economy to start growing from the deep hole it was in i am happy to report that all the indicators are pointing in the right direction gdp growth rate has more than doubled from  in  the lowest in two decades to  in  inflation has reduced from  at the end of  to  in march  interest rates are going down we are witnessing a more stable cedi fiscal deficit has reduced from  in  to  of gdp in  and there are positive signs of revival in the industrial sector with growth increasing from an abysmal negative  in  to  in  we have made a number of deliberate interventions to reduce the cost of doing business and formalize the economy the ebusiness registration system the paperless port clearance system the digital addressing system the mobile interoperability system and the national identification card system would all help quicken the pace of change to bring us into the technologydriven era and make our businesses competitive it is in pursuit of the same aims that we have abolished a raft of nuisance taxes to shift the focus from an emphasis on taxation to an emphasis on production the reduction in electricity tariffs is a major plank in this policy and the effects should be visible soon in an improvement in cost of doing business and confidence in the economy as a whole chairperson it is not often that there is such good news on the economic front in our country so i believe it bears spelling it out here that as from april residential customers are enjoying a  reduction nonresidential customers such as tailors fitters barbers hairdressers carpenters mechanics electricians and chop bar operators have seen their electricity bills cut by  the mining companies are now benefitting from a  reduction whilst special load tariff customers such as our manufacturing companies and industries are also enjoying a  reduction long may it continue that our affairs are managed efficiently to enable relief to be brought to the ghanaian consumer and industry as these reforms and changes work their way through the system i am certain that we should very soon be seeing a vigorous turnaround in the creation of jobs in the private sector to build on the jobs created in agriculture through the programme for planting for food and jobs there has also been recruitment into the public sector of personnel in critical sectors like education where thirty three thousand one hundred and sixty  teachers were recruited by the ghana education service and in health where sixteen thousand five hundred and two  new health workers were employed thirty two thousand  more nurses will be employed this year it is important to note that there was no employment in the public sector in these two critical areas for more than three years before my government took over last year governments commitment to job creation will be manifest through the accelerated implementation of our flagship programmes of one district one factory one village one dam and the vigorous implementation of projects by the development authorities and the zongo development fund the planting for food and jobs programme that was launched last year has been successful and is being improved upon based on the lessons learnt this year we are expanding the programme to cover five hundred thousand  farmers up from the two hundred thousand  that were beneficiaries last year before i got to the stadium here i had the happy duty to launch the nation builders corps this programme which i am glad to learn has the full support of the trades union congress will take on one hundred thousand  persons this year and should provide some relief from the depressing fate that has become the lot of so many young graduates they will be paid gh¢ a month which is a modest but important beginning for the restoration of their dignity other transitional job creation avenues existing under the youth employment agency yea also continue to offer opportunities for young school leavers to develop their skills and to create their own enterprises these are not the long term sustainable jobs that would characterize our economy when it is in full gear but we need some dramatic interventions in the interim and i have no doubt that they would provide the breathing space and the platform from where many young people will launch successful careers i remember that during last years may day parade one of the issues that took centre stage was the ecg concession and the fear of layoffs of ghanaian workers you will recall that in my address i pledged that the terms of the agreement would be in ghanas interest i am happy to report today the existence of an mou between organized labour the ministry of energy and the ministry of employment and labour relations which will ensure that no worker of ecg would be negatively affected or laid off as a result of the coming into effect of the ecg concession again the majority of shares of the ecg concessionaire ie  after the signing of this agreement are in the hands of ghanaians chairperson secretary general we know we can only become that selfreliant and prosperous nation our forebears envisioned for us when we industrialise and add value to our economy a world class labour force is needed for this and that can only be achieved through education it is clear that education is the gateway to the highpaying jobs of the future a good start to ensuring that all of ghanas children get an equal chance to this has been the introduction of free shs which ensures that all children access a minimum of secondary education with money no longer a constraint all students who sit this years bece and gain access to senior high school will be beneficiaries of free shs together with their colleagues who are currently in shs  chairperson secretary general we are agreed that free shs is important for all of us but i dare say the skills development that is offered by the technical and vocational aspect in particular is equally critical and i hope i can count on the support of the tuc to help push tvet to the level it deserves to be we shall be able to transform ghanas economy and reduce unemployment when we pay attention to technical and vocational training that is where the skills needed for the modern economy can be developed the strategy is to expand technical and vocational opportunities at both secondary and tertiary levels and thereby strengthen the linkages between education industry and the world of work as well as empower young people to deploy their skills to employ themselves and others workers of ghana what i envisage in the technical and vocational education sector would involve a truly radical change in attitude on the part of all of us throughout the years enough lip service has been paid to the tvet sector this time we are backing the talk with money and political will this time the interventions will be focused and seen through to proper conclusion and that is why we have decided to bring all tvet institutions under the supervision of the ministry of education instead of under the  agencies which hitherto were responsible for tvet to provide for better coordination and training as we seek to establish a worldclass labour force comparable to any in the world we must address the concerns of workers in the public sector over their remuneration an interministerial committee has been established by the ministries of employment and labour relations and finance to undertake the review of the single spine pay policy sspp and to make recommendations for implementation by government having operated with the policy since its inception in  it is time to institute this review the team is expected to do a thorough review of both public and private sector pay policies not only in ghana but also across the globe to make informed recommendations for implementation productivity should be taken into consideration in the determination of remuneration for work done by employees in both the public and the private sectors whilst we seek to review the remuneration i continue to count on you secretary general to lead the campaign for a change in attitude to work and increase in productivity this government through the ministries of finance and employment and labour relations has with the cooperation of the tuc ensured the smooth transfer of gh¢ billion of tier  pension funds into the custodial accounts of the pension schemes of labour unions funds that had been outstanding for six years and about which tuc had been loudly complaining our concern has been to ensure that the pension funds are secured ahead of their retirement persons who have also been nominated to chair these schemes are well equipped and possess the necessary experience in the management of the affairs of the schemes workers can be assured that their contributions and accompanying investment returns are safe and would be promptly disbursed as and when they retire from active service nonetheless mr secretary general i have listened to your concerns and the call for the setting up of a special committee to review tier i and tier ii pension schemes and will be looking forward to receiving the proposals of organised labour for the review let me also assure the secretary general that the composition of the board of the national pensions regulatory authority has been completed and will be sent shortly to the council of state as is required by law already the council of state has concluded its consultation on the composition of the boards of the national labour commission and the fair wages and salaries commission both of which will be inaugurated within the next week let me at this stage applaud organised labour heartily for the calm industrial climate our nation has enjoyed over the last  months this has been the result of the greater engagement by tripartite partners and government through the diligent and hardworking minister for employment and labour relations hon ignatius baffuor awuah member of parliament for sunyani west i look forward to the continuation of the constructive dialogue with organised labour to find mutually satisfactory solutions in order to guarantee industrial peace i welcome the partnership of organized labour with government and the private sector so that we can work together to develop homegrown solutions to our problems this would present us with the most effective path to realising the vision of a ghana beyond aid that is why i am setting up a  committee comprising  members each from government ministries of finance planning and employment and labour relations organised labour and the private enterprise federation to work out under the chairmanship of that good servant of the ghanaian people hon yaw osafo maafo the senior minister in the next six months a charter on ghana beyond aid the charter will then be subjected to scrutiny and debate by parliament and adopted as a follow up to the coordinated programme of economic and social development policies the nation will then know in detail how we intend to move ghana to a situation beyond aid it is propitious then that ghana completed yesterday its and reviews of the imf programme leaving two more to be done before the completion of the programme this year this takes to three the number of successful reviews achieved by this government since august  the previous administration managed to register just three reviews in three years the end of the programme means that we will have the space to design our own social and economic programmes without jettisoning the fiscal discipline and proper economic management necessary to give entrepreneurs the predictability and stability to plan properly invest boldly to grow their enterprises and create jobs the charter on ghana beyond aid will then come into its own chairperson ladies and gentlemen i must now turn my attention to a matter that should concern us all child labour is a problem that must be addressed in a manner consistent with our humanity our international obligations and in the context of our history it is regrettable that some amongst us permit their children to undertake activities that affect their health education and development negatively mainly because of their lack of awareness about or indifference to the rights of children ghana has ratified all the applicable international conventions and passed the childrens act of  our children must be treated as children and do what children do they must be in school learning to be the productive citizens of tomorrow whilst attending school children must only perform child work which prepares them for the future the daily spectacle of children weaving through traffic on our roads and hawking all manner of things when they should be in school must affront our conscience and spur us to action government is working with all partners towards the goal of eliminating child labour we aim to ensure that our children do not work under hazardous conditions to support themselves and their families before i end chairperson secretary general workers of ghana i wish to stress again that our nation cannot continue to be dependent on the production and export of raw materials and expect to be a prosperous and wealthy nation we must turn our back on the old economy and build a valueadded industrialised economy with modernised agriculture which is neither victim nor pawn of the world economic order our relations with the world must be characterised by an increase in trade and investment cooperation not aid this is the way to develop healthy relations with other countries and put ghanaian products at the high end of the value chain in the global market place and create jobs for the teeming masses of ghanaians particularly the youth the vision is to build a free prosperous independent country a ghana beyond aid whilst we pay tribute to past labour leaders like the great pobee biney anthony woode vidal quist john tettegah and others for their outstanding contribution to the liberation of our nation from colonialism i am hopeful that todays generation of labour leaders will also leave their own indelible marks on the history of our country as we seek to fulfil the dreams of freedom and prosperity that animated the founders of ghanaian nationalism organised labour must help in the realisation of the  sustainable development goals for they are an investment in our future – the future of our youth and that of our children we are obliged to leave them with an enduring legacy of a more prosperous more stable more secure more just and more peaceful world let me in conclusion commend the tuc for holding this national event outside accra just as it has done on some previous occasions i believe more national events like independence day celebrations should follow the tucs lead and be held outside the nations capital who knows next year why not tamale for independence day may god bless us all and our homeland ghana and make her great and strong i thank you for your attention

      " i salute you with the greetings of peace in islam asalam alaikum we thank the almighty allah for seeing us through one month of fasting prayer and devotion to his cause we give gratitude and praise to him for the life of our nation and for the lives of all ghanaians i pay tribute this morning to our learned national chief imam shaykh dr osman nuhu sharubutu for his leadership and guidance of the muslim ummah in ghana shaykh it is to your credit that the muslim ummah continues to live in harmony with one another we pray for allahs continuous blessing for you if islam is to live up to its accolade as a religion of peace it behooves on all muslims to embrace one another irrespective of doctrinal differences indeed our country stands unique in west africa both in terms of inter and intra religious cooperation ghana is home to persons of virtually every religious denomination they all go about their religious practices without hindrance we ought to guard this tradition of religious cooperation and tolerance jealously the one month period of intense devotion to god will have little meaning if it does not continue to reflect in our attitude as ghanaians the prophet muhammad peace be upon him sallallahu allayhi wasalam is reported to have urged muslims who are provoked in the month of ramadan to say we are fasting i believe that this response to provocation which engenders peace in muslim communities during ramadan should be cultivated as an everyday response to provocation a muslim is the brothersister of another muslim so says the prophet of islam it is this spirit of brotherhood and sisterhood that should guide our responses to one another not only as muslims but as ghanaians chief imam ulama when it comes to the spirit of living together we are the envy of many nations today many muslim homes will play host to christian neighbours and friends as we all eat and drink and share in the glory of god as a christian president i have a muslim as my vice president i have a cabinet made up of muslims and christians and in which both christian and muslim prayers are said at every meeting on january this year we celebrated  years of the republic the longest lasting republic of our history holding for the first time in our national life on that day an official interfaith service of commemoration and thanksgiving to god christian and muslim religious leaders came together to conduct that service in the presence of the four living presidents of the republic which i daresay was a beautiful moment for all ghanaians such arrangements are rare in many countries around the world and we ought to be proud of ourselves for being capable of doing such things even so we must not be complacent they say the price of liberty is eternal vigilance i urge you to be on the lookout for trouble makers and hate preachers amongst us the security agencies will not hesitate to deal with those who incite hate not even if they do so in the name of islam or christianity my government remains committed to the welfare of the muslim community in ghana the vice president that worthy son of islam alhaji dr mahamudu bawumia continues to engage with muslim communities around the country so that we are constantly keeping abreast with the challenges of muslim communities he just completed his annual ramadan tour that brought him to many of the mosques across all ten regions of ghana for the second year running he has held an iftar fast breaking event at the jubilee house with muslims of all persuasions i want to assure you that this is a tradition we intend to keep so long as by the grace of god we inhabit the jubilee house  when i addressed you last year i promised you that i was going to set up a zongo development fund to help cater for the development needs of the zongo communities as we had promised in the  npp manifesto i am happy to report that the fund has been set up and on monday june i inaugurated its board under the chairmanship of a distinguished muslim the chief of nima alhaji mohammed farl popularly called nii futa already the minister responsible for zongo and innercity development the hardworking hon alhaji boniface abubakar siddique mp for madina has been busy about his mission development projects have started in many zongo communities around the country in asawase in kumasi for example we have started the process of desilting the pelele river that runs through the community we are also building major drains in the community to stop the perennial flooding that occurs in the area and cuts it off from the rest of kumasi during the rainy season apart from physical development we also aim to roll out a comprehensive programme that develops the talents of our young men and women in the zongos we know that several of the national football icons that this country has produced have been muslims and many of them from zongo communities – baba yara dogo moro mohammed salisu mohammed polo golden boy abdulrazak anas seidu mohammed choo abedi pele mohammed gargo and baba amando amongst others we want deliberately to establish the conditions that allow our young talented zongo youth to engage and develop their talents to this end the zongo development minister is building astro turfs in zongo communities to create a conducive environment for the training and development of sporting talent the one being constructed in madina here in accra should be a good model the prophet mohammed peace be upon him sallallahu allayhi wasalam has admonished muslims to seek for knowledge even if you might travel to china in another vein he says that knowledge is the lost property of a muslim let him seek it wherever he may find it we therefore cannot be muslims and ignorant at the same time my government is committed to making education accessible to all so that we are not just educated for life but muslims also fulfil their religious duty i urge you to take advantage of the free senior high school programme to ensure the education of your children especially the muslim girl government has also engaged some three thousand arabic instructors to teach arabic studies in schools i am very passionate about the development of women in islam it is believed that paradise lies under the feet of our mothers our mothers and potential mothers cannot hope to guarantee us paradise if they are allowed to remain ignorant ulama jama i appeal to you to pay as much attention to the education of your female children as you do to the education of your male children the eloquent minister for gender children and social protection otiko afisa djaba has embarked on a campaign to dissuade parents from marrying off their teenage girls i urge you to embrace that campaign let us allow our muslim girls to realise their full potential all the mothers of the faithful were not just educated but they remain to this day an important source of our knowledge of the precepts of islam and since embracing the sunnah is an essential part of faith let us embrace his conduct in relation to the education of girls as well national chief imam ulama jama i am happy to be with you once again may the

      " last week on june  our nation suffered an unexpected grievous loss – the sudden departure of the immediate past vice president of the republic his excellency kwesi bekoe amissah arthur vice president for four and a half years under his excellency president john dramani mahama our nation has been observing five days of national mourning official books of condolence have been opened at the accra international conference centre and in our missions across the world and flags have been flying at halfmast he will on july receive a full state burial and funeral as befits a former vice president especially one who has served his nation with dignity and integrity i have already extended on your behalf and my own our sincere condolences to his widow his children his family the national democratic congress and president mahama we have earlier had a minutes silence in his memory may his soul and the souls of all the faithful departed rest and abide in the bosom of the lord until the last day of the resurrection when we shall all meet again the last time we met in  in tamale to select our national officers we were in opposition having lost the elections of  and  it was thus imperative that we elect officers who would unify the party and mobilise all its talents and energies to lead us to the allimportant victory of  unfortunately that did not happen our party became embroiled in a series of unnecessary disputes that undermined the coherence of the party fortunately for us we benefitted from the akan adage that the family that does not have elders is a family to be pitied the council of elders under the intrepid leadership of the veteran nationalist and statesman ck tedam stepped into the breech and initiated the process that led to the suspension of three senior elected national officers and a handful of others for antiparty activities that decision saved our party and kept alive our possibilities of victory we owe the council of elders especially its leader ck tedam a great debt of gratitude for their action an action whose validity when challenged was affirmed by the accra high court we are equally deeply indebted to the national officers who took on the responsibility of leading our party in those difficult circumstances despite the constant taunts of our opponents – how can they manage ghana when they cannot manage their own affairs how can a divided party govern ghana – these were the constant themes of john mahama and the ndcs campaign – they rose to the task kept their focus fostered unity amongst us and helped lead us to a famous historic victory a victory that has brought us back to office to give us the opportunity to implement our ageold programme of transformation and development we thank them profusely for their service to the party and to the nation to all our outgoing national executives ellembele blay freddie blay frederick fredua antoh john boadu sammi awuku otiko afisa djaba kwabena abankwah yeboah and kamal deen abdulai i say a big ayekoo well done your names are written in letters of gold in the annals of our party and i will never cease to praise you for your stalwart defence of the interests of the npp in its moment of peril the events that happened in tamale underlie the critical importance of selecting the right persons to manage our affairs for the future ie for the next four years the persons we elect today will have the daunting task of organizing our party for the  election in two years time it is a huge challenge and we need the right people to meet it let me repeat some of the words of my message to conference we must elect officers whose principal goals will be to unify the party strengthen its base and machinery work handinhand with government and ensure that we give this country good governance to bring progress and prosperity to all of our people we must make sure that the posttamale events never occur again we must maintain and safeguard the gains of  by electing the right persons to do so what then have we done in these last  months with this power that we sought so passionately and which the almighty was so gracious to bestow on us with the support of the ghanaian people broadly four things first we had to get the economy working again it was not when we came into office  gdp growth rate for  – the lowest in two decades – that was the achievement of the last year of mahamas government including an imf bailout programme because of the measures we took we posted an  gdp growth rate in the first year of our mandate and there is every indication that we will repeat that this year indeed the imf is saying that we could have the fastest growing economy in the world this year and that our prospects for positive growth are good we have brought the unsustainable fiscal deficit down from  in mahamas last year to  in  we will get it further down this year the rate of inflation has improved from   we are now in singledigit figures the cedi is a more stable currency despite its recent challenges we have begun to restructure our debt to give us greater fiscal space i know there are some who think these figures are meaningless they are wrong the figures point to a growing stronger macroeconomy without that we cannot deliver prosperity digging us out of the deep hole the mahama government plunged our country into was never going to be easy but we have to do it we have to be disciplined in the management of our public finances otherwise our aspirations for a better tomorrow will remain just that – aspiration not reality our economy is on a good course and it will mean that when we finish with the imf programme this year our economy will be stronger than the one we inherited we have to thank members of our excellent economic management team for that vice president mahamudu bawumia its chair senior minister yaw osafo maafo finance minister ken oforiatta trade and industry minister alan kyerematen energy minister boakye agayrko agriculture minister dr owusu afriyie akoto – these and others are those who are working hard to turn our economy around i know that things are still not easy but if we stay true to the path we are charting we will see very soon the light at the end of the tunnel let us remain resolute we will deliver prosperity secondly whilst we have been working to turn our economy around we have also been keeping some of our key promises to the people of ghana the sceptics and the naysayers have been put to shame – free shs is now a reality last academic year ninety thousand more young boys and girls got into senior high school than they did the year before because of the policy this year the figure will double to one hundred and eighty thousand and to take care of this additional population we are going to recruit over eight thousand more teachers we are going to ensure that every young ghanaian child no matter where he or she is born no matter the financial circumstances of his or her parents will have access to a minimum of quality secondary school education we have doubled the capitation grant we have expanded the school feeding programme we need an educated workforce to build century ghanaian prosperity we have restored teacher and nurses trainee allowances we have revived the national health insurance scheme much of the debt that was strangling it has been paid by judicious management and the card has become meaningful again because service providers are now being regularly paid we have stabilized power supply and have now made dumsor a thing of the past and in the process we have significantly reduced electricity tariffs we have abolished many nuisance taxes so small businesses can breathe again we have instituted the national entrepreneurship and innovation plan neip to support young entrepreneurs and their startups we have expanded the leap programme we have increased the share of the district assemblies common fund that goes to persons with disability we have begun to revive our agriculture with the programme for planting for food and jobs last year two hundred thousand small holder farmers were in the programme which provided them with subsidized improved seeds and fertilizers and extension officers who had previously been nonexistent the result was an increase in the production of maize from  metric tons per hectare in  to  metric tons per hectare in  an increase in the production of rice from  metric tons per hectare in  to  metric tons per hectare in  an increase in the production of soya from  metric tons per hectare in  to  metric tons per hectare in  and an increase in the production of sorghum from  metric tons per hectare in  to  metric tons per hectare in  this year the programme will be extended to embrace five hundred thousand farmers our target is one million farmers by the end of the fouryear term we are going to change the face of ghanaian agriculture we have finally established the development authorities and the zongo development fund to address questions of infrastructure at the grassroots we are ready to roll out the  initiative and construction has begun in parts of the northern regions of the  project the revitalization of our railway system is going fullsteam ahead and we are about to witness significant road developments the hundred thousand strong nation builders corps has been launched to ltackle graduate unemployment so that our security personnel are not left out of this broad programme of social and economic reform we have increased the peacekeeping allowance from  to  digitization and formalization of the economy has begun in earnest and all this has been done in  months four and a half years of mahamas government was bereft of any such achievement we are focusing these interventions on the ordinary ghanaian because we believe strongly that economic growth has to be broadbased if it is to be meaningful and what do all these interventions mean in real terms – they mean that government has provided relief of some gh₵ billion for the betterment of the ordinary ghanaian this is money in their pockets the npp will never be a party for special or vested interests we stand and will always stand for the entire ghanaian people the third aspect of our concentration these last  months has been to improve the structure of our governance we have begun to take the steps towards the radical reform of local government – the pledge to bring full democracy to local government is on course we have scheduled the referendum to remove the entrenched clause of article  of the constitution to permit direct popular election of metropolitan municipal and district chief executives to coincide for reasons of cost with next years district assembly elections we are in the midst of the process of regional reorganization to accommodate popular demand for the creation of new regions to bring governance closer to the doorsteps of the people the brobbey commission has completed and submitted its work together with their recommendations the recommendations are under study by that outstanding minister hon dan kwaku botwe mp for okere prior to their reference to the electoral commission to conduct the relevant referenda to solicit the popular verdicts of the affected peoples reforms of the public procurement process to shift it from an emphasis on sole sourcing to more competitive tendering enabled savings of nearly gh₵ billion to the public exchequer last year we have seen greater accountability of public officials the allegations of corruption and or misconduct against the two deputy chiefs of staff at the presidency against the ministerdesignate for energy against the minister for trade and industry in the socalled cashforseat scandal against the suspended upper west regional minister were investigated by independent agencies ie the police or parliament and found to be baseless and without foundation that was the basis for my lifting the suspension against the upper west regional minister and returning him to his office yesterday on my return in the evening from the state visit to south africa i received the police report on the australia visa scandal which has exonerated the suspended deputy minister for youth and sports from any complicity in the visa fraud i will lift his suspension on monday and return him to office i will maintain this approach during my entire tenure the same principle of accountability motivated governments decision to call for a police inquiry into the conduct of the then president of the ghana football association as revealed in the now famous anas aremeyaw anan number  documentary and to begin the steps for the dissolution of the gaf in order to create the grounds for sanitizing the administration of football in our country one of the most important developments in strengthening the architecture of our anticorruption system has been the establishment by act of parliament of the office of special prosecutor a body independent of the executive with a remit to hold all public officials past and present accountable for their stewardship of public funds the first occupant of this office is a noted anticorruption crusader whose independence of spirit and sense of integrity have been well acknowledged i am confident that he will do his duty without fear or favour illwill or malice respect for due process and constitutional propriety led me to discharge the heavy duty of giving effect to the recommendations of the constitutional body that investigated the petitions against the former chairperson of the electoral commission and her two deputies i acted as directed by the constitution without any malice or premeditation and all those who are familiar with the genesis of this sad affaire will recognize the truth of my statement but i am aware that the professional critics and those who still cannot adjust to the expression of the popular will of december  will continue to strain every sinew to find a case where there is none i will continue to do my duty and will leave their effusions to the verdict of history there is one major decision that i have taken which i know has generated a lot of anxiety amongst many of you and that is the decision against galamsey i stated at my inauguration that safeguarding the environment would be one of my most solemn undertakings i meant it i have said and will continue to say – mining is an essential feature of our economic life we have always mined here in ghana akufoaddo cannot stop mining activity what he can do and is trying to do is to put in place measures that will ensure like our forefathers and ancestors did that mining does not destroy our landscape or pollute our water bodies already some of our rivers are regaining some of their purity the roadmap for lifting the ban will be published in due course and hopefully the rules and regulations it will contain will ensure that we do not go back to the bad old days we are working not just for ourselves but also for our posterity finally during this period on the international front i have visited every ecowas country except guinea bissau to deepen and strengthen our bilateral relations and ties of cooperation with them we have been active in ecowas and are playing our role constructively in the quartet of nations in the processes leading to the adoption of a single currency for the ecowas community by  when the call to duty to the gambia came we were part of the ecowas peacekeeping mission that guaranteed peace in that country following the ouster at the ballot box of former president yahaya jammeh i have been designated by ecowas comediator together with the guinean president his excellency prof alpha conde in the efforts to resolve the togolese political crisis your president is cochair of the group of advocates of eminent persons for the implementation of the  united nations sustainable development goals and has also been designated au gender champion we have been very active in the affairs of the commonwealth and indeed at the last commonwealth heads of government meeting chogm in london your president was given the honour of proposing the toast at the official banquet at buckingham palace to queen elizabeth ii of great britain the head of the commonwealth yesterday i returned from a state visit to south africa the first such by a foreign leader to that important country during the presidency of matamela cyril ramaphosa the new president of south africa since february of this year we have struck strategic partnerships with our neighbour cote divoire and with south africa last year we received several world leaders a testimony to the growing reputation of our country as you can see we have been very busy these last  months and even though we have not addressed all the sticky problems of the country we are working hard to bring about the rebirth of our nation it is obvious that the destiny of ghana is safe in our hands let us work to ensure that we stay in office long enough to effect the social and economic transformation of our nation that our people require we can and will do it i dare say we are the only ones who can do it so long as we remain united and focused on the big picture and see ourselves above all as instruments of service to the ghanaian people so building a stronger party delivering prosperity to ghanaians is a very apt theme we will develop our nation in freedom let me end on a word of caution the harmonious relationship between members of parliament mmdces and constituency executives is very important for the success of our project i have said it and i will repeat it here i am the captain of the boat and i will not allow anybody to rock or capsize it the boat is going to sail into safe harbour no curve no bend thank you for giving me the time to speak let us have a successful conference and elect the right people to steer our affairs may god bless all of us and the new patriotic party and may god bless our homeland ghana and make her great and strong    ghana is a west african country bound on the north by burkina faso on

      " i am glad to be able to join you for this years internal audit conference being organized under the auspices of the internal audit agency i note that you have chosen as the theme for the conference leadership and good corporate governance a key to effective public financial management i have no doubt at all that you have laid out a phalanx of experts to talk on various aspects of the theme which hopefully will yield a lot of useful insights with your indulgence i intend to direct my comments to your role as internal auditors in the conduct and management of public financesmaybe we should start with matters on which there appears to be general agreement there is widespread dissatisfaction among the general public about the integrity of dealings in our public institutions more than sixty years after our independence we have not been able to achieve anything near the promise of our expectations during these sixty years there have been many moments of renewed hope when we have felt that we have yet another opportunity to get things right somehow these opportunities have largely turned out to be unfulfilled leaving the people with a sense of betrayal ladies and gentlemen i am determined that the sense of hope that was rekindled on january  will not peter out i know that there is no better way to retain the confidence of the people than to ensure that public institutions work i know that i shall keep hope alive when people believe that both the government i lead and myself are serious about the fight against corruption in public life as internal auditors you constitute the first line of defense in that fight against corruption if you do your job well you provide an independent and objective assessment of an institutions operations specifically the effectiveness of its internal control structure when something is going wrong it can be quickly discovered internal auditors when they function well use a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate and provide assurance services and improve the effectiveness of risk management control and governance processes if internal auditors are working well structures of governance will work smoothly let me give you an example of what i am talking about an example of what happens when public officials like internal auditors do their work i have been given to understand that the public procurement authority by simply reviewing contracts brought before it for approval under either sole sourcing or restrictive tendering has in the past  months saved the country some gh¢ billion the whole of  the authority made zero savings this is what can happen when our institutions work in your own individual work places you can cite your own examples of what you would save the country simply by insisting that people go by the book we are human and i acknowledge that there will always be those among us who would try to abuse the system and undermine whatever structures there are there will be those who would try and see what they can get away with and there are those who might be making genuine mistakes it is precisely because we acknowledge the reality of human frailties in all our endeavours that we have internal auditors the daily and constant checking of systems ensures that the public purse is respected and protected when people know that they cannot get away with spending  cedis of public money without accounting for it they hesitate to take  or  or  cedis every time that we all wince at the details of the reports of the auditor general at the hearings of the public accounts committee of parliament we know that our internal auditors are not working as they should unfortunately it has become a routine for the auditor general to uncover cases of financial malfeasance in the public service that would otherwise go unnoticed until he or she appears it is not pleasant but we cannot avoid the conclusion that the internal auditor must be either complicit or incompetent we cannot afford to have internal auditors that would be complicit in the malfeasance they are expected to prevent and certainly we do not need incompetent ones from what is euphemistically termed petty corruption to what must be called grand corruption the truth is that corruption thrives when no one is checking in our circumstances when there are so many things that need to be done when roads schools hospitals houses need to be built it becomes even more urgent that we plug all the avenues for the leakage of public funds in our circumstances when hopes have been dashed so many times we dare not allow the current opportunity to go to waste internal auditors working as they should would bring confidence into the public sector internal auditors working as they should would keep in check not only the lowly clerk but also the chief executive and yes the president as well internal auditors working as they should do not generate any drama but quietly and effectively they ensure the smooth running of their departments every time there is drama we can be certain that the internal auditor has not been effective ladies and gentlemen i came to this function to emphasize for the avoidance of all doubt that the internal auditor is one of the primary weapons in the fight against corruption i came to reiterate that i need your help in the fight against corruption i came to renew publicly the sacred vow that i took to protect the public purse i came also to acknowledge that this is not a battle i can wage or win alone there are many layers to the protection of the public purse and internal auditors are its primary defenders a propos i want to say that the stringent and desperate efforts being made by my political opponents to tarnish me and members of my family with corruption will simply not wash i did not come into public life to make money out of public service and members of my family know fully well that they have to behave and are not involved in anything untoward i am aware that you give a dog a bad name in order to hang it but this dog will not be hanged i acknowledge the fundamental role that internal auditors play to prevent detect and reduce corruption leakages and waste of public resources internal auditors help to ensure accurate and timely information which helps to improve financial management systems in organizations internal auditors lead in the safeguarding of resources and help to strengthen the control system compliance with laws policies and procedures in organizations internal auditors provide assurance and advisory services to enhance operations and help the organization to achieve its objectives even more important is their role in ensuring accountability transparency and the quality of performance in the organization ladies and gentlemen we need to perfect all stages of our public financial management system to enable us maximize the use of our resources institutions such as the auditorgeneral internal audit agency eoco and other statutory institutions will continue to be empowered to carry out their mandate so that relevant laws and policies are complied with the recent internal audits carried out at the youth employment agency yea state housing company ltd shc and others brought out a number of worrying issues the recommendations from these audits must be implemented to advance the fortunes of these organizations i believe internal auditors have what it takes to contribute to good corporate governance and good leadership in the public sector we promise the auditors our support in fulfilling their mandate under the internal audit agency act  act  and the public financial management act  act  we shall support auditing to bring transparency and accountability into our public financial system i am well aware of the frustrations and disappointments of staff especially in terms of low remuneration or compensation which sometimes engender such issues i have spoken on a number of occasions about the importance of time management and the need to increase our productivity but it is also important to realize that when time and other resources are not spent optimally resource generation becomes a problem and the vicious cycle of low productivity low resources and low compensation continue to swing from one end to another i know there are unresolved issues of salary disparities conditions of service and work environment and these are receiving the urgent attention of government so that they can be satisfactorily resolved ladies and gentlemen i wish to conclude by assuring ghanaians that government is on the right path to secure what is good for the country and will endeavour with gods grace to work hard to reach our goal let us all work hard and we shall achieve the prosperous and happy ghana we all envisage chairperson i pray that your deliberations at this conference will be fruitful and will bring sound suggestions for positive changes in ensuring that we build a good corporate ghana with purposeful leaders in all sectors and at all levels of organizations i look forward to receiving a copy of the communiqué on the outcome of your work may god bless us all and our homeland ghana and make her great and strong thank you for your attention     ghana is a west african country bound on the north by burkina faso on

      "madam president secretarygeneral your excellencies ghana salutes the historical significance of your election to preside over this session of the general assembly as the first female latin american and congratulates you most heartily madam president your election reinforces our common preoccupation that gender equality must be a central feature of the global agenda madam president thirteen days ago we laid to rest in his home soil of ghana kofi annan the secretarygeneral of the united nations the first from subsaharan africa to occupy this exalted position on behalf of the people and government of ghana i wish to extend our heartfelt gratitude to the united nations secretariat led by the secretarygeneral his excellency antónio guterres and the whole world community for the outpouring of grief and condolences that we received on the passing of kofi annan we were deeply touched that so many world leaders and people took the trouble to come to accra to bid him farewell kofi annans passionate and profound belief in the united nations and his certainty that a better organised and stronger un would make the world a better place is an ideal that should not be allowed to die today we continue to be faced with the stark reality that resolutions norms and any number of votes in the security council and general assembly mean nothing without the political will to enforce them we are still to come to terms with what the role of our organization should be should it just be a club of nation states that exists to look after their own interests what of its constitution by we the peoples as declared in its founding document does the theme we have chosen for this assembly have any relevance in real life and do we want to make the united nations relevant to all people do we want an organization that ensures shared responsibilities for peaceful equitable and sustainable societies or should it remain the place to pass resolutions that are ignored with impunity madam president when some of the nations of the world gathered in san francisco  years ago and signed the landmark document that created this organization it was a very different world from what we have today and i do not refer only to the difference in the numbers in the room on that occasion nor the difference in the mode of travel that brought the leaders to that meeting and the jet planes that have brought us all to new york this week nor do i refer to the tweets by which we communicate now and the elegant handwriting that they employed back in  i refer to the theme we have drawn up for this general assembly and wonder if it would have been comprehensible to that group in san francisco it is a different world we currently live in and we should accept that this organization must change to suit contemporary needs madam president ten years ago as the general assembly was starting its proceedings the world was plunged into a financial crisis the first scenes of that crisis were played out on a street not far from where we are gathered but the consequences were felt and are still being felt around the world and in small countries like ghana some say that upheaval lies at the heart of the change in politics and outlook around the world today as we speak a trade war is being stoked between the two largest economies of the world the consequences will affect those who have had no say including small countries like ghana these events provide proof if some were needed that ours is an interdependent world we in ghana and other parts of the african continent are determined to pull our country out of poverty and into prosperity    we do not think that a nation needs to remain poor or become poor for others to become prosperous we believe that there is room and there are enough resources on this planet for us all to be prosperous but it does mean that the rules and regulations that we fashion to guide our dealings with each other have to be respected by all of us from the environment to trading rules we have to accept that there cannot be different set of rules for different countries thus far the united nations provides the best vehicle for all nations to address their aspirations and challenges ghana has always displayed her belief in the united nations and sought to contribute her share in making the organization a successful one     we have embraced the sdgs and integrated the seventeen ambitious goals into our national vision and budget we intend that ghana will in july  take her turn to present our voluntary national review during the ecosoc highlevel political forum and we will share our successes and challenges as well as opportunities for new and continuing partnerships madam president it is important to reiterate that advocating for a world order in which all countries sign up to obey the rules does not mean that we want uniformity we take pride in what distinguishes us as africans and as ghanaians  of the work of the security council last year had to do with africa unfortunately this invariably meant peacekeeping and poverty related issues we no longer want to be the place that requires peacekeepers and poverty fighting ngos no matter how noble their motives our regional bodies like ecowas and our continental body the au are making systematic efforts despite significant handicaps to bring peace and stability to the entire continent and sooner rather than later they will succeed we know we must get our population educated and trained and we are setting about it we must address our infrastructural deficit the traditional methods of tackling this problem will not provide the answer we are looking for new ways to resolve it ghana like many countries in africa is forging relations with china to make arrangements to help address part of our infrastructure deficit this is not a uniquely ghanaian or african phenomenon it has not been lost on us that the developed rich and wellestablished countries have been paying regular visits to china and seeking to open new economic ties and improve upon existing ones it is also not lost on us that a lot of anxiety is being expressed about the possibility of a recolonization of the african continent by a new power we should indeed learn from history it was at the turn of the century that chinas first railways were built by western companies financed by western loans to a nearly bankrupt qing dynasty and it was under those circumstances that a certain strategic port called hong kong was leased for  years and the rest as the saying goes is history today the former victim of western railways imperialism is lending billions to countries throughout asia africa and europe to construct not only railroads but also highways ports power plants and other infrastructure and many businesses the historical echoes are certainly worrisome but yes surely we must and can learn from history we in ghana must build roads bridges railways ports schools hospitals and we must create jobs to keep our young people engaged it is obvious to us that the development trajectory we had been on for many decades is not working we are trying a different one and we would appreciate the support and goodwill of the world especially in helping to stem the huge flow of illicit funds from the continent it is in everybodys interest that we who are counted amongst the poor of the world make a rapid transformation from poverty to prosperity we are determined in ghana and increasingly in more and more parts of africa to chart our own paths to prosperity and pay our own way in the world we are no longer interested in being a burden on others we will shoulder our own responsibilities and build societies and nations that will be attractive to our youth we have the necessary sense of enterprise creativity innovation and hard work to engineer this transition hence our vision of a ghana beyond aid indeed of an africa beyond aid madam president it is equally important that the united nations is reformed to be able to preside over this changed and changing world to which we all aspire the powerful nations must be willing to adapt to the changes to make our world a better place after all we all inhabit the same planet and we all owe the same duty of care to ensure its survival the african common position on un reform as expressed in the ezulwini consensus remains the most comprehensive proposal for reform of the united nations particularly of the security council it is time the global community endorsed it to create a modern united nations

      " i begin with words from holy scripture in psalm  verse  and i quote this is the day the lord has made we will rejoice and be glad in it today is a very happy day for me it is a day when we begin the process of banishing the spectre of desperation and restoring hope and dignity to our youth vice president ladies and gentlemen you will recall that on tuesday may  at the great hall of the kwame nkrumah university of science and technology i launched the nation builders corps programme a programme designed to assist in the public sector delivery needs of our country in addition to creating employment avenues and opportunities for young people who hold diplomas or degrees from accredited tertiary institutions the scheme would engage the raw talent of our graduates and equip them with skills through a process of valueaddition and training however as has become the norm with every bold initiative proposed by this administration this programme predictably was not only ridiculed in certain quarters but also met with pessimistic and sceptical comments with some going to the extent of urging graduates from our nations tertiary institutions not to register for the programme the one hundred thousand  young men and women who are present did not listen to the loud cries of the cynics and jeremiahs they rose up to the challenge signed up for the programme took part in the rigorous selection process and are passing out as ghanas first nabco trainees i salute all of you young men and women for taking this innovative step to lay the foundation for your future careers and at the same time contribute your quota to the growth and development of our nation the one hundred thousand  nabco trainees will be deployed in seven critical aspects of our economy ie education revenue mobilization agriculture health governance digitisation and the private sector they are going to assist in the realisation of governments vision of an educated population an industrialised robust and wellmanged economy the delivery of good governance and for the sustenance of all these a reliable skilled and efficient workforce additionally the nabco trainees will be engaged in a structured work and learning programme environment for every four weeks of work one week will be dedicated to acquiring soft future employability and work readiness skills within three years nabco trainees would have obtained  weeks of solid training and value addition to enable them transition smoothly into the world of permanent work by this we would have also addressed the very issue that keeps our graduates out of the labour market in spite of their educational qualifications the managers of the programme have struck up a partnership with the council for technical vocational and educational training cotvet and some universities both domestic and foreign for the validation of the content of the learning programmes so that the trainees receive appropriate certification of their skills and training for their deployment to the ghana revenue authority ghana education service ghana health service information services department local government service ghana investment fund for electronic communications the ministry of food and agriculture and the ministry of trade and industry in nabco we have planted the seeds of the growth and future of our country i am in no doubt whatsoever that nabco will succeed when the current trainees are about to exit the programme present concerns over their future will appear moot this is because trainees would be equipped and will thrive without recourse to nabco planning their exit arrangements nonetheless the scheme has wellconstructed and clearly defined exit routes our public services and institutions having benefitted from the services of nabco trainees over the threeyear period will naturally have opportunities that allow the retention of trainees who have justified their value another pathway is the building of an entrepreneurial base among the trainees the ministry of business development and the national entrepreneurial and innovation plan are involved with this exit pathway the goal is to have five hundred business leaders mentoring  nabco trainees under the enterprise ghana module a dedicated fund amounting to the equivalent of their thirdyear allowances is to be made available for them to start their cooperative ventures an equivalent matching fund will be sourced from a private investor to complement the gh¢ million fund again we have employed creativity in the design of an exit pathway focussed on education for example the university college of education winneba and university of cape coast are to provide academic support to train the many nabco personnel with diploma in basic education this will provide them with certificates and guarantee careers in the early childhood care and development sector i admonish our nabco trainees to be dutiful and productive in the areas you have been assigned i urge you to demonstrate on a daily basis that you value knowledge as a basis for effective performance and productivity you must show your professional credentials through timeliness and punctuality and above all live beyond reproach so you can discharge your responsibilities with efficiency so that all at the end of the day can vouch for your integrity your performance will be monitored through an innovate mobile application which will be deployed soon nabco trainees must bear in mind that government is investing some gh¢ billion of taxpayers money into this programme your monthly stipend of  ghana cedis is not free money and you must earn every pesewa of it through hard work and dedication which i am confident you will do to the ghanaian people you will feel the presence and contribution of these one hundred thousand  nabco trainees in your towns and villages your constituencies and districts and in critical sectors of the economy work with them and believe that together we can build a progressive and prosperous nation the equal of any on the face of the planet i cannot conclude these brief remarks without paying tribute to the invaluable contribution to the takeoff of this programme by my brilliant vice president alhaji dr mahamudu bawumia and his hardworking team whose dedication and leadership from the time of conception through to implementation has led us to this point i know i am not alone in aspiring to see a transformed ghana which has joined the ranks of developed nations and moved to a situation beyond aid ie a ghana beyond aid as you return to your respective destinations to commence work your marching orders are clear – help build a nation you will be proud of live by the core values of knowledge punctuality and integrity live as nation builders let us together fulfil the dreams of progress and prosperity that animated the great patriots whose toil and sacrifice brought us our freedom and independence accordingly vice

      " i am very happy to be here this morning and to be in the presence of the men and women whose toil on a daily basis feeds us keeps us alive and plays an important role towards the development of our country without the work of our farmers and fisherfolk it is certain that we cannot realise the united nations sustainable development goal no  which requires that we seek sustainable solutions to end hunger in all its forms by  achieve food security and improve nutrition with the majority of the ghanaian people involved in agriculture a day set aside to celebrate their achievements is welldeserved and let me reassure our farmers and fisherfolk of governments continued support and solidarity with them today is also about the policy makers and implementers businessmen along the agricultural value chain research institutions and other key actors in the agricultural sector building synergies through the effective collaboration of these stakeholders is essential if we are to succeed in achieving the nations goals in the agricultural sector ladies and gentlemen the theme for this years celebration agriculture moving ghana beyond aid imposes a duty on all of us to help ensure that the selfreliance we seek in all aspects of our national life encompasses agriculture this means that we have to take bold decisions underpinned by strong political will to move away from practice of business as usual to innovative and resultsdriven approach of doing things in the sector it requires a paradigm shift from productionbased to businessoriented agriculture which promotes value chain development and entrepreneurship the agenda of transforming agriculture calls for investing our resources in critical areas of the sector with a view to stimulating growth on a sustainable basis government is doing everything possible to put agriculture on the path of transformation since assuming office we have left no one in doubt about the importance of agriculture as one of the cogs for accelerating economic growth it is also important to put on record that ghanas agriculture was in a state of decline when i became president of the republic prior to  the performance of the sector had been erratic recording a growth rate of  in  one of the lowest in modern times it improved albeit slightly to  in  and that told no better story this growth pattern was a reflection of a lack of prioritization and support for the agricultural sector by the previous government their neglect of agriculture found expression in low farm yields high postharvest losses low level of mechanization poorly motivated and low numbers of extension officers largely unavailable marketing infrastructure weak linkages to other sectors and a general lack of access to agric financing having effectively diagnosed the problems of the sector the current government took the decision to tackle comprehensively the issues confronting the sector and work towards harnessing effectively its potential the launch of the programme for planting for food and jobs pfj in april  strongly signalled governments determination to reverse the flagging fortunes of the agricultural sector consequently planting for food and jobs focused on improving the yields of farmers guaranteeing access to markets reducing postharvest losses and enhancing the availability of extension services nearly two years into its implementation i can confidently report that very positive results have been achieved in particular the distribution of farm inputs to farmers a major component of the programme has worked very well the provision of improved seeds and subsidised fertilizer has largely accounted for high farm yields and impressive growth of the agriculture sector of  at the end of  the first pilot year of the pf chairperson for  the projections are looking even much better with higher anticipated levels of success given the intervention and expansion made in the programme this year five hundred and seventyseven farmers have been enrolled onto the pfj programme an increase of seventyseven thousand  more farmers over the targeted figure of five hundred thousand  in  of this number a total of two hundred and seventyeight thousand  farmers have been captured through a biometric registration exercise aimed at developing a reliable farmer database in the country towards ensuring selfsufficiency in food production government has undertaken the following initiatives  arrangement put in place to import farm machinery worth two hundred and sixteen million dollars  million in  the machinery and equipment will be used to revive the one hundred and sixtyeight  existing agricultural mechanization service centres amsecs across the country and to establish new ones the machinery will be used for land preparation planting harvesting and primary processing of produce  construction of eighty  new warehouses across the country each with a capacity of one thousand  metric tonnes in addition to these five  existing warehouses have been rehabilitated an additional thirty  warehouses will be constructed in  to increase storage space for anticipated high yields from the pjf intervention these facilities will be equipped with seed cleaners dryers and weighing scales to help address the problem of postharvest losses   and rehabilitation of various dams and dugouts to increase crop production and ensure all yearround farming so far in  eightythree  hectares of land have been made available for irrigationadditional dams will be constructed in  to support the one village one dam programme it

chairman the list is by no means exhaustive as other interventions will surely come on stream in  as presented by the minister for finance in the recent budget statement the positive results so far in the agriculture sector shows that we are on course towards realising the vision of agriculture helping to move ghana to a situation beyond aid   of the aquaculture for food and jobs afj programme in

chairperson as much as we are on course we recognise that we are by no means out of the woods yet our strategy of linking agriculture to industry under the one district one factory programme value chain development and diversification improving agricultural infrastructure and mechanisation amongst others will be aggressively pursued in  ours is a government for farmers and fisherfolk we will continue to prove this by deeds and not by mere rhetoric evidence abounds for all to see that the agricultural sector is receiving unprecedented support through massive investment aimed at transforming and modernising the sector i invite all partners to continue to work closely with government to ensure that the potential of the agricultural sector is fully maximised for the benefit of the people of this country we will continue to work hard to ensure agriculture regains its pride of place in the country and our farmers and fisherfolk are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve now chairperson to a very important announcement which will equally be of much interest to our farmers and fisherfolk this year government has added to the national awards package for farmers and fisherfolk a total of twentyfour  scholarships for the wards of farmers and fisherfolk the scholarships are for local tertiary programmes ranging from first degree to phd in any agricultural subject of their choice this gesture is a further testimony of governments commitment to making agriculture attractive to all especially the youth i want to end by thanking and congratulating the farmers of ghana for their great response to governments programme for planting for food and jobs which has enabled our country not only to experience a bumper harvest this year but also for the first time in a long while to export food to our neighbours i appeal to them to give even greater support to our policies in agriculture as they unfold in conclusion chairperson it is often said that if you can read thank a teacher should we not then have the farmer and fisherfolks version – if you have eaten today thank a farmer and a fisherman may god bless our famers and fisherfolk and may god bless

      "  speech by the president of the republicnana addo dankwa akufoaddoat the independence day celebration parade at the aliu mahama stadium tamale on wednesday march  it is with much joy and pride that i join you to celebrate the anniversary of our nations independence at this stadium named appropriately after one of the outstanding figures of the republic and a native of this city the late vice president alhaji aliu mahama who left us so prematurely and whose dignified widow hajia ramatu mahama is with us here we continue to honour his memory  i extend hearty congratulations to all ghanaians from the vibrant and dynamic city of tamale capital of the northern region this is the day we justifiably celebrate the collective energies and sacrifices of our forebears that led to that joyous night when our historic first leader kwame nkrumah uttered the immemorial words ghana your beloved country is free forever we will defend that freedom with the last drop of our blood as we remain dedicated to its preservation  i extend also on behalf of all ghanaians a warm welcome to our guest of honour a good friend of mine and of our nation his excellency mahamadou issoufou president of the brotherly republic of niger fellow member state of the economic community of west african states ecowas and his delegation many of his compatriots whom we call zamramas have been living amongst us in peace and solidarity for over a hundred years contributing positively to the growth of our economy his presence on this day in our midst will be a source of considerable pride to them we are delighted that he has accepted our invitation to share this special day with us akwaaba your excellency is our word of welcome we say also nakayooo as the zamramassay and jabbamain fulani  i am glad to see that all the high officials of state – the vice president the speaker of parliament the representative of the chief justice the chairperson of the council of state the chief staff at the office of the president ministers and deputy ministers of state the majority and minority leaders of parliament members of parliament the chief of defence staff of the ghana armed forces the inspector general of police and service commanders are all present here for this ceremony and it is heartening to note that the former presidents of the republic their excellencies jerry john rawlings president of the republic and john dramani mahama the president of the republic and  presidential candidate of the opposition national democratic congress and the former lady her excellency hajia ramatu mahama are also present in this stadium today is indeed our national day we welcome also the dean and members of the diplomatic corps  fellow ghanaians for the first time in our nations history this ceremony is being held outside our national capital city of accra tamale was chosen as the venue not only to underline the unity of our nation but also to express the appreciation of the nation for the peace and the process of reconciliation that have engulfed dagbon since the enskinment of yaana mahama abukari ii as overlord of dagbon on january i welcome him to this event as i do the former regents of dagbon the kampakuya na and bolin lana who have recently been enskinned as yoona yakubu abdulai andani savelugu na and mion lana mahamadu abdulai respectively i say a special welcome too to the nayiri naa bohugu abdulai mahami sheriga overlord of mamprugu and the yagbonwura tuntumba boresa sulemana jakpa overlord of the gonja state two of the members of the committee of eminent chiefs who together with its chairperson the asantehene otumfuo osei tutu ii were so instrumental in designing the roadmap whose implementation has restored normalcy to dagbon i salute them all  after decades of being identified with unrest and disharmony dagbon has good reason to celebrate and it is fitting that we use the opportunity of our independence anniversary celebration to converge here and celebrate with them on the theme of peace and unity  on march  when we celebrate the independence of ghana we celebrate the strength that comes from speaking with a united voice we celebrate the coming together of different peoples to make the united and strong nation of ghana  the diversity that went into weaving the fabric of ghana is a source of strength and not of weakness it is a source of pride and not of shame just watch the master kente and fugu weavers at work and you will appreciate the strength that comes from the coming together of different and varied yarns to make a strong fabric with intricate and beautiful designs our languages might be many and sometimes there might be mutual frustration at having difficulty in speaking each others language and no one feels that more than i do when i stand here in tamale unable to speak dagbani but we have learnt to overcome such difficulties we celebrate the variety of foods available under the theme of ghanaian cuisine and the variety of clothes that constitute ghanaian fashion  indeed the things that are now the source of friction amongst us are not the familiar and ancient differences of tribe and language  sadly chieftaincy has generated more disputes and disharmony than any other institution the tragedy is that by chieftaincys very nature only people from the same family can and do lay claim to the same stool or skin  i said in parliament a fortnight ago that spurred on by the momentum from the dagbon settlement the hardworking minister for chieftaincy and religious affairs the hon kofi dzamesi is going to intensify his efforts to try and find solutions to other longstanding chieftaincy disputes  fellow ghanaians it is important for us all to pause awhile examine and take a critical look at the chieftaincy institution in our nation when it works our chiefs provide the cohesive link to our past and what defines us as a people  when chieftaincy works it is an embodiment of our culture and the rock on which we lean for support and to which we resort in times of trouble in many parts of our country our chiefs are the custodians of our lands and their activities can be the spark for development or for disputes  where the chiefs have united their people and offered forward looking leadership modernization has been rapid where there has been disunity the area has lagged behind and the disputes have been a drain on the public purse  the very survival of the institution is at risk unless we get over the multiplicity of disputes for many young people the pomp and pageantry which are often all they see cannot make up for the amount of trouble chieftaincy generates  for some young people the insistence on doing things the same way they have been done whilst resisting any change make the institution unattractive the poverty that bedevils some of our lives can only be defeated and overcome when we are united and pull together  it is sad for me to have to state that the other institution that has been the source of friction in our society is politics we the leaders of the political parties have a great responsibility to set a proper tone for political discourse in our country  for years a deliberate campaign was waged in this country to give competitive politics a bad name to justify military or authoritarian rule competitive politics was said to be divisive antagonistic and corrupt well we learnt from painful experience that military or authoritarian rule could be corrupt and divisive  it took a long time for a consensus to emerge but it did and we all agreed that the form of government within which we would want to conduct our affairs should be a multiparty democracy which under the aegis of the republic has provided us with the longest uninterrupted period of stable constitutional governance in our history  under a multiparty democracy there would necessarily be a divergence of opinions indeed democracy thrives on debate on passion on argument and sometimes even on raised voices in the midst of the arguments and the raised voices there is and must always be mutual respect for the opposing viewpoints under a multiparty democracy we must have elections that would invariably be keenly fought there is no room and there should be no room for violence in this whole process it should be a contest of ideas that seeks to win over the hearts and minds of the people  success should be counted by how many young people go to school and get skills and jobs and not by how many young people can be marshalled to disrupt elections or how many broken bones we can count the people of ghana do not deserve to be toyed with in such a reckless manner the very concept of political violence is offensive and shames us all who are in politics that is why i am determined that hopefully the impending dialogue between the two major political parties the new patriotic party and the national democratic congress who between them regularly take more than  of the vote in elections who have provided all the seven governments of the republic and who are the only two parties currently represented in parliament should succeed i will spare no effort including the initiation of the relevant legislation to ensure that we rid our nation of politicallyrelated violence  we are in the process of reconstructing the ghanaian state by devolving more and more power to the people so that people in their localities and communities become more and more empowered to take decisions about matters that affect them and thereby enhance the ease of administration the creation of six new regions and thirtyeight  more districts and the decision to expand full democracy to local government are part and parcel of this process of reconstruction which will be the bedrock of the fairer freer more efficient and prosperous ghana we want to construct  two years ago at my inauguration as president i asked that we build a confident ghana which is united at peace with herself and takes pride in her diversity i challenged us to accept that being a ghanaian must stand for something more than the holder of a birth certificate or a certain passport  i asked that being a ghanaian must put certain responsibilities on each one of us and calling yourself a ghanaian must mean you have signed up to a certain definable code and conduct  fellow ghanaians let me remind all of us again that being a ghanaian puts an obligation on each one of us to work at establishing a progressive and happy nation and calling yourself a ghanaian must mean we look out for each other it means also that we must look after the land the trees the rivers the mountains the animals all of gods creatures that represent this nation of ghana this is at the heart of the fight against galamsey to which i am irrevocably committed  i do not imagine that this ghanaian i envisage should be an angel far from it we would have all our human foibles but we would operate within the agreed perimeters of our society this is the cue to mention our security services who help to maintain peace and order so we can get on with the business of running our affairs i congratulate the security agencies for their work and their readiness to put their lives on the line for the rest of us and urge them to continue to be professional at all times let me say a few words on our police service because we need a credible and professional police service to be able to have a peaceful and united society we cannot have a successful police service without the cooperation of the population the cooperation starts with giving respect to the police and encouraging them to earn the trust of the people by serving the public with dedication  i am glad to note that the police service is moving to modernise its own rules and regulations we should hold them to their vision to become a worldclass service capable of delivering planned protective and peaceful services to the standards of international best practice in a democracy  for the first time since the colonial gold coast era the police service instructions that govern every aspect of internal professional behaviour have been wholly revised from the code of ethical conduct to administration welfare recruitment and training use of firearms the new service instructions puts into writing specific directions for every rank – police orderlies charge officers crime officers regional and divisional commanders commissioners of police through to the authority of the inspector general of police himself in every aspect of their work the police must police themselves first  i am glad also to note that the service has launched a new communication and education strategy that sets out explicitly how the service must conduct itself and engage in communicating with the citizens of ghana  in a region and continent plagued by several incidents of strife our police have seen the ravages of war and helped to stabilise the peace they have served in international peacekeeping operations in just about every trouble spot in the world – in liberia sierra leone cote divoire namibia kosovo bosnia georgia and iraqcurrently our officers from the ghana police service are providing peacekeeping duties in both the sudan and south sudan as well as in somalia and the central african republic  they serve with distinction wherever they go in this respect i congratulate chief superintendent phyllis osei for winning the distinguished award in  of the un female police officer of the year she is the first ghanaian female officer to win this global award  i am pleased to announce that like our armed forces who serve with distinction on peacekeeping duties members of the police service who represent us abroad have also seen their daily allowances increased from  to  us dollars  i am happy to see that finally the northern regions of our country under the programme for planting for food and jobs are beginning to fulfill their potential of being the food basket of our nation and region the manner in which farmers in these regions have embraced the programme is a matter of great encouragement for me  fellow ghanaians i am glad that we are here in tamale for this years celebration i hope it will spur on many people to get to know our country we have a beautiful country and it deserves to be explored and admired apart from the joy of discovering the beauty and charms of our country getting to know ghana helps to dispel the prejudices of the unknown  those who have the means to do so should consider it more important to travel around and know ghana before they embark on the next vacation to dubai it means of course that the tourism authority has its work cut out if they get it right with internal ghanaian tourists then they will be ready to cope with foreign tourists  i urge those who live in the big cities in particular to get around the country a little it just might change their outlook and make them a little more tolerant of the difficulties that we need to overcome i congratulate the people of tamale for being such gracious hosts this has never been done before and doubtless we shall learn from the experience the success of the tamale experience may however set the trend for the rotation of this ceremony  i hope that very soon we shall be hearing some exciting news about developments in the northern region twelve  years ago after deliberate and focused investment in the upstream sector we discovered oil in commercial quantities offshore the western region since coming to office two years ago i have directed the ghana national petroleum corporation to invest systematically in the voltaian basin covering six adjoining regions including the northern region here to search for oil onshorei am confident that our search will not be in vain and that very very soon these areas that have been characterized by avoidable levels of poverty will be buzzing with significant investments and creation of jobsour efforts are not limited to petroleum and agriculture alone again we shall soon be introducing a bill in parliament that will add new focus in the promotion and establishment of an integrated iron and steel industry in ghana an industry whose natural resource iron ore is in abundance in these areas  fellow ghanaians we have dubbed this year the year of return to commemorate the anniversary of the arrival of the first  west african slaves in the commonwealth of virginia which subsequently became part of the united states of america we intend to use the symbolism of this year of return to bring together africans persons of african descent and all wellwishers and lovers of freedom to strengthen the commitment to ensuring that blots on our history such as the transatlantic slave trade and slavery never reoccur it means that we are expecting many many visitors to our shores this year and we must all collectively and severally be on our best behaviour and make them feel welcome several diasporans of african descent who have lived with us for many years will as part of the year of return receive their longawaited ghanaian citizenship  as we celebrate our nations birthday we should be fortified in the knowledge that despite our challenges and difficulties we are on course to reaching our goal of a ghana beyond aid that is realising the vision of the free fair democratic selfreliant prosperous ghana governed by the rule of law and respect for human rights that inspired our forebears to fight for the liberation of our country and continent from foreign domination let us remain steadfast and united – the goal is within reach  i wish all ghanaians a happy anniversary and i thank once again his excellency mahamadou issoufou president of the republic of niger for gracing this occasion  may god bless us all and our homeland ghana and make her great and strong  i thank you for your attention      ghana is a west african

      "i am happy to have the opportunity to be amongst you again on this special day the third of my presidency that is set aside to celebrate work and workers across the globe today is the international day of solidarity for all working people ghanaian workers ayekoo i do not think we exaggerate if we say that work is at the centre of all human life and human existence we spend the first twenty or so years of our lives preparing for work we then spend the next thirty to forty years in formal work and if we are lucky we spend the last twenty or so years in retirement the quality of this period of retirement depends very much on how we manage the time we spend in work  i know i state the obvious but i do want to make the point that i do not need to be persuaded about the importance of work and the circumstances in which we work i also want to reiterate the fact that we are all in it together whether it is in management or government or on the shop floor the project of our existence succeeds if we work together and we pull together  our nation ghana at  remains very much a work in progress and lots of things remain to be done to improve upon the quality of our lives in all three stages the period of preparation towards work the period during which we work and the period during which we take a deserved rest from work  the lopsided nature of things in our country is demonstrated by the statistic quoted eloquently in the speech by the general secretary of the trades union congress that is the workforce in our country is estimated at about  million and those in formal work number about  million the government of ghana employs about  of this number and more than  of all government revenue is spent on the remuneration and conditions of service of those of us in this group very few of us among the  on the government payroll are satisfied with our circumstances and i am sure we have all heard some of the main sources of unhappiness among the litany of complaints read out by the representative of organized labour in the  months that it has been my honour and privilege to be president of our country i have been as candid as possible with the people of ghana even if sometimes the truth has been unpleasant let me try and bring out a few wellknown facts of our condition  i believe there is some consensus on what we all want for ourselves and for our country we want a healthy educated and skilled population we want wellpaid and satisfying jobs and we want a welldeveloped network of infrastructure in the country in  years we have not managed our affairs to enable us have the money to deal with the serious deficit in our infrastructure development without borrowing money i suspect that even if we spent  of all government revenue on remunerations for the  or so people on the public payroll there would still be dissatisfaction with conditions from some people  ladies and gentlemen i believe it is time we face reality and start asking ourselves some of the difficult questions development remains our collective responsibility and aspiration should we continue to pay greater attention on improving the conditions of the few who are in jobs or should we concentrate on creating the atmosphere for more jobs to be generated for years we all said many public officials were pushed into corrupt practices because they were so badly paid salaries and conditions of service have been improved for many and we have not seen the equivalent improvement in the quality of the work they do  this year the theme for our may day celebration is sustainable pensions for all the role of social partners the theme takes us to what i identified as the third stage of our workcentered existence it assumes we have acquired the skills needed for the life of work and we have jobs and can look forward to a time of satisfying retirement everyone knows the critical contribution of labour to the production process economic growth and sustained development it is important that the dignity of labour is maintained throughout retirement  the passage of the national pensions act  ushered ghana into a new pension regime characterized by a threetier pension scheme as we all know this scheme is made up of a basic national social security scheme tier  an occupational pension scheme tier  and a provident fund and personal pension schemes tier  currently pension fund assets are reported to have grown from gh¢ billion representing  of gdp in  to gh¢ billion representing  of gdp in  fund assets have therefore kept growing since the implementation of the threetier pension scheme this has provided an opportunity for private sector pension operators or companies to thrive in  the national pensions regulatory authority npra registered and licensed  corporate trustees  pension fund managers and  pension fund custodians this rapid growth in total pension assets can be attributed mainly to increased private sector participation in the pension sector the availability of sound investment guidelines and an independent regulatory body npra that oversees and ensures compliance with good practices in addition tier  offers opportunities for workers in both the formal and informal sectors to make voluntary contributions this is a most welcome innovation into our pension regime indeed formal sector workers who contribute to tier  schemes have an added advantage in that their pension obligations are deducted before tax i look forward to all ghanaian workers recognizing the importance of pensions and gaining confidence in the sector the current system gives the individual worker the opportunity to have absolute control over his or her pension through effective and transparent management as i told you last year over three billion cedis ie gh¢ billion of pension funds funds that had been outstanding for six years and about which tuc had been loudly complaining were transferred in  from the temporary pensions fund account tpfa at the bank of ghana to the appropriate occupational pension schemes pension fund managers and trustees have a lot of work to do to build and retain the trust of workers for many people this is all new and unchartered territory and there are understandable anxieties that must be assuaged by working with the highest level of diligence and honesty in managing the resources entrusted to them  i acknowledge that there are unresolved issues with the social security and national insurance trust ssnit and the npra i have asked the minister for employment and labour relations to liaise with ssnit and npra to bring finality to all outstanding issues in the next three  months in much the same way that we should build trust between workers and the new private pension companies it is equally important that there is trust between workers and the state established ssnit i am informed that the ministry of finance has arranged for the payment of gh¢ and a bond of gh¢ million towards the retirement of the arrears owed to ssnit this will leave arrears of gh¢ million which will be included in next years budget  we will build a robust economy and a prosperous society when we put in place a sustainable pension scheme for all workers for far too many of our people the end of their lives is marked by poverty too many people either have no pensions at all or have inadequate pensions to match the needs of old age in the informal sectors of the economy especially most people work without any thought to pension coverage and when they no longer have the strength to work their lives become miserable  our societies have changed old people can no longer regrettably count on their children to look after them in their old age i hope and pray that we never lose the ghanaian values of accepting responsibility for and looking after our old people but that should not stop us from organizing things to ensure independence and dignity to the old during retirement  since about  of workers operate in the informal sector we must focus our attention on extending access to that sector in compliance with the national pension law at the moment government efforts are on course to establish a cocoa farmers pension scheme this trend would be extended to other worker groups in the informal economy fellow countrymen and women another way of widening the pension base is of course to reduce unemployment we are working on an economic transformation agenda through the various job creation initiatives such planting for food and jobs onedistrictonefactory industrial stimulus package planting for export and rural development private sector support schemes which are all beginning to bear fruit and should soon start reducing unemployment and provide opportunities for citizens to work earn higher incomes and contribute to their pensions a year ago i made special mention of the importance of the tvet sector in equipping our young people for the world of work i promised that we would back the talk with action i am glad to be able to report that we have made important progress we have funding for  state of the arts tvet centres parliamentary approval has been given for all  nvti centres to be upgraded retooled and curricula improved and teachers trained it also includes the building of two new foundries and two machine making factories and the completion of nvti headquarters we have also got parliamentary approval for all  technical universities and technical institutes to be reequipped retooled and rehabilitated  in other words ladies and gentlemen we know the areas of sustainable job creation and we know that we need well trained technicians to build our country we are making realistic and effective efforts to ensure that we produce those that generate work and pensions  i also wish to encourage our social partners employers and enterprise owners to comply with existing pension regulations and support their staff to contribute to pension schemes we should all spread the news about the importance of pensions and the structures in place to ensure transparent and effective management of pension funds  ladies and gentlemen government is determined to consolidate further the relations between the social partners in the post imf era that is why on  april  government signed a landmark social partnership agreement with organised labour represented by the trades union congress the ghana employers association and government represented by the ministries of finance and employment and labour relations to provide a medium for building a sense of cohesion trust selfmanagement frank and open discussions to champion the course of development towards realising the vision of a ghana beyond aid government is committed to a new social contract that promotes social dialogue in economic management and in the making of public policy it is also to assure you our workers and businesses that you are our true development partners and your ideas are critical in my governments model for economic management and development  i will soon inaugurate a social partnership council with equal representation from the three social partners i am very confident that this new approach to economic management and public policymaking will foster even greater cooperation and trust among our partners together we can achieve a more stable economy peace at the labour front and prosperity for the good people of ghana before i conclude there is one important matter i have to address at last years may day celebration in kumasi i informed organised labour and the country about my intention to establish a multistakeholder committee to develop a charter and a strategy for the vision of ghana beyond aid the committee chaired by the senior minister has the ministers for finance planning local government and rural development employment and labour relations monitoring and evaluation and information as members  trades union congress tucs own secretary general dr yaw baah and vice chair mrs philomina sampson are also members the leadership of association of ghana industries private enterprise federation ghana national association of teachers ghana national chamber of commerce and industry and national union of ghana students nugs among others also played important roles the committee has worked tirelessly to produce a charter and a strategy document which will guide our march towards ghana beyond aid and i am happy to outdoor this document today on behalf of the people of ghana i wish to thank the ghana beyond aid committee for the good work done ghana beyond aid is setting our nation on an irreversible pathway of prosperity with the blessing of the almighty and our collective effort we will march boldly from poverty to prosperity so that we can create the ghana our forefathers envisioned the current generation aspires to have and our posterity will be proud to inherit – a ghana which is selfsufficient and prosperous governed according to the rule of law respect for human rights and individual liberties and the principles of democratic accountability the ghana of our dreams  i thank you for your attention and congratulate all workers on this occasion for their hard work over the past year and crave your continuous support in the national development effort long live ghana long live the workers of ghana

designation of  as the year of return and the events that emanated from that decision have certainly left an afterglow that ghana can and must cherish ghana became the centre of attention in the african diaspora and indeed much of the world as we led the way with events of remembrance to commemorate  years since the first captured africans arrived in the americas in what became the beginning of the ignominious transatlantic slave trade the event being commemorated left deep scars and remains the source of unimaginable grief for all peoples of african descent but it provided a great opportunity for us to demonstrate our triumph over adversity throughout the year and culminating in a glorious cacophony of celebrations ghana was the centre of attention in much of the world we played host to people from all over the world young and old men and women black and white joined in spectacular celebration a joyous rediscovery of our common identity and humanity exploring what we can do together through political cultural and economic engagement to make our future brighter and better one our future descendants will be proud of mr speaker it is a matter of great pride to me that all ghanaians embraced the year of return and helped to project such a positive and endearing image of our country my heartfelt thanks to all ghanaians and to members of the house in particular for the enthusiastic welcome that was extended to our visitors and for making the year of return such a resounding success  but we are not yet done we are building on the foundations of the year of return to a new level the next stage of our reengagement with the african diaspora with the theme beyond the return  the government is seeking to build on the success and we are putting measures in place to take us beyond the return the ministry of tourism under its eloquent leader hon barbara otenggyasi member of parliament for prestea hunivalley and the rejuvenated ghana tourism authority under its dynamic chief executive akwasi agyemang are leading the charge to make our country an attractive and irresistible destination a place of pilgrimage a nation that everyone with a hint of african blood must visit at least once in their lifetime  i should thank two people in particular who have embraced their ghanaian heritage and have played a key role in our effort to building lasting bridges between ghana and africanamericans hollywood star boris kodjoe and international marketing icon bozoma saint john we are grateful to both of them for leveraging their starpower to attract thousands to the land of their fathers and to drive a fresh narrative that says ghana is a land of opportunity visit invest make it your home we appreciate deeply their contribution and that of many others to the success of the entire project  mr speaker i can testify to the renewed enthusiasm around the world for our country my trips to germany france austria japan russia the caribbean this past year have brought tangible dividends and there are growing investments in ghana from companies in those countries   the emphasis in our foreign relations remains with our immediate neighbourhood and that means ecowas and the african union and ghana continues to play a leading role in making these organisations active and relevant to the changing needs of our region and continent   i cannot ignore the difficulties that currently exist in ecowas especially with nigeria our ageold friend and largest member nation closing its land borders for the past five months and the instability and terrorist activity that is sadly blighting the lives of thousands in some parts of nigeria and shedding innocent blood in the sahel and our neighbours to the north of our country we are playing a positive role in the efforts being made within ecowas to bring this boundary impasse to an end which will hopefully be sooner than later the successful implementation of the accra initiative involving the consistent collaboration and cooperation of security and intelligence heads from ghana and her neighbouring countries namely cote divoire burkina faso togo benin mali and niger continues to be our concrete contribution to the fight against terrorism in our region through joint security operations such as koudangou and the ongoing operation conquered fist we continue to reinforce the security of our northwestern northern and northeastern borders to guard against any infiltrations into the country all of us have a vested interest in helping to maintain the peace stability and security of ghana in the current troubling circumstances of our region   mr speaker we never lose sight of the fact that there are many ghanaian communities in all parts of the world and our missions abroad have been charged anew to be alive to their needs i am happy to report that ghanaians in the diaspora are very much involved in whatever happens in their home country wherever i go i meet with them and they are often very well informed and insistent on accountability from government officials   let us never forget that the remittances from ghanaians abroad constitute a healthy part of our economy and i always encourage them to bring their acquired skills to invigorate the political and economic landscape   mr speaker it is important that i make special mention of ghanas relationship with the peoples republic of china which has grown exponentially over the past few years the dramatic economic transformation of china in the past two decades is a marvel to the world and a lesson for the rest of us in the developing world we have entered into various agreements with china the lead one obviously being the sinohydro agreement which seeks to deliver many infrastructural projects   mr speaker today china is unfortunately battling an outbreak of the deadly  virus we sympathize with the people of china at this time of great trouble i have written to president xi jinping to convey to the government and the people of china the solidarity and sympathy of the compassionate people of ghana we trust that with the tough decisions being implemented to curb the spread of the virus this nightmare will be over and soon they will recover from its devastating social and economic impact  there is a sizeable ghanaian community in china and our government through our embassy has been working with the chinese authorities to find the best way to deal with the situation   the ghanaian community includes four thousand seven hundred and sixty  students out of which three hundred  are studying in hubei province and two hundred  in the city of wuhan the epicentre of the outbreak we have a difficult and delicate situation on our hands mr speaker and it does not benefit anybody to try to score points by introducing illjudged politics into this ongoing medical conundrum and humanitarian tragedy   most of these students are on chinese government scholarships and since the crisis started the chinese government has done its best to keep them supplied with food and other logistics the ghana government through its mission also supplies logistics and the embassy has given so far five hundred united states dollars  to each student   however we know that no amount of logistics will make up for the extreme stress and trauma that these young people are going through and i entreat members of this honourable house to set an example by helping to pour oil over troubled waters instead of instigating tension and spreading fear and panic among the young people the government is in constant touch with experts on the subject who advise that the basic principle of public health is to confine the disease to the area of its origin but we have not ruled out the option of evacuating the students from wuhan if that becomes necessary we have put in place measures to ensure that their evacuation back into ghana if it happens does not lead to the dissemination of fear and panic amongst the general population  mr speaker i have spent time talking about how well we are doing on the international scene and the many plaudits that are showered on ghana wherever i go but the test of how well our country is doing can and should be measured by how ghanaians themselves feel about their situation   ten days ago our vice president and chairman of the economic management team alhaji dr mahamudu bawumia made a presentation at a town hall meeting in kumasi in which he gave a detailed and comprehensive account of the performance of the economy under three years of management by an npp government led by me he went to great lengths to identify the promises that had been made in the  manifesto that we took to the country this document spelt the agreement between the elected government and the people of ghana   i do not intend to go through all over again the meticulous accounting that was done in kumasi ten  days ago it is enough to say that it being dr bawumia everything he said was backed by data and his customary factchecking he ended by asserting that seventyeight percent  of the promises we solemnly made to the people of ghana have been or are in the process of being fulfilled there has so far been no factual challenge to his compelling testimony  mr speaker in three years we have reduced inflation to its lowest level  in january  since  for the first time in over forty  years we have had a fiscal deficit below five percent  of gdp for three years in a row for the first time in over twenty  years the balance of trade that is the difference between our exports and imports has been in surplus for three  consecutive years our current account deficit is shrinking interest rates are declining and the average annual rate of depreciation of the cedi is at its lowest for any first term government in the fourth republic our economic growth has rebounded to place ghana among the fastest growing economies in the world for three years in a row at an annual average of  up from  in  the lowest in nearly three decades the international investor community has recognised this development resulting in ghana today being the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in west africa the sovereign credit ratings agencies have upgraded our ratings and also improved the outlook for this year notwithstanding the fact that it is an election year this is a massive vote of confidence in the current management of the economy as best illustrated by ghanas successful issue of the longestdated eurobond ever issued by a subsaharan african country with investors placing fifteen billion united states dollars  billion of orders for ghanas fortyone  year eurobond the seven  year bond attracted the lowest coupon rates ever for ghana at six point threesevenfive percent  compared with the nine point twofive percent  ghana had to pay for a similar eurobond issue in  no wonder bloomberg the reputable global financial media house earlier this week highlighted ghana as the top candidate for an economic leap in africa this expression of confidence is important because it will lead to enhanced investments in our economy and the accompanying greater numbers of jobs  we inherited a collapsing financial sector that has led to failing banks and considerable agony to many people the government is having to conjure thirteen billion cedis gh¢ billion to pay the  million affected customers of the banks  this is money that we can illafford and which would have gone to fund the many things that our communities are crying for properly utilised thirteen billion ghana cedis would work wonders with our perennial infrastructure deficit but we did think long and hard about paying all the customers of the failed banks and we believe we made the right decision i would like to repeat that all depositors of the savings and loans and microfinance institutions including dkm which collapsed in  will receive  of their deposits too once the validation exercise is concluded and i am informed that the receiver of the savings and loans and microfinance institutions will begin on monday  february making payments to their customers these monies totaling five billion cedis being in addition to the thirteen billion cedis being paid to the customers of the failed banks  we hope that lessons have been learnt and this will serve as a healthy caution to those who are offered unrealistic interest rates on deposits i do not think it will be possible to repeat this grand payup in another lifetime i want to assure ghanaians that we are going to hold those who have been responsible for these failures of financial institutions the supervisors and management of these institutions accountable a process which has already started we expect that those whose job it is to supervise the banks and other financial institutions will do their jobs honestly and competently  i am very encouraged by the many corporate governance measures that have already been put in place by the bank of ghana under the strong leadership of governor ernest addison to mitigate such bank failures in the future thanks to the banking sector cleanup today i am happy to say that ghanas weak banking sector that we inherited is now wellcapitalised better managed sound and liquid and the banks are now increasing their lending to the private sector to help propel the transformation of the economy beyond aid  mr speaker a year ago i started my speech here in parliament with a reference to the happy events in dagbon and my presence at the enskinment of the new yanaa mahama abukari ii i am glad to report that about a month ago the nowfirmly in place yanaa paid a historic visit to jubilee house i do not think jubilee house has ever witnessed such scenes it would be fair to say that the yanaa and his entourage certainly shook up the place and nobody would be forgetting that dramatic colourful visit in a hurry   dagbon is gradually regaining her selfconfidence and i hope the house will join me in wishing that ancient kingdom the goodwill patience and tolerance her elders sons and daughters need to continue the healing process and grow from strength to strength  mr speaker the peace that currently prevails in dagbon is required for progress and development throughout the country we have spent a lot of money to ensure that the security agencies that are charged with maintaining law and order and keeping us safe are well resourced to enable them perform their duties police numbers have been increased and will be increased further until we meet the recommended ratio   the police have been provided with more vehicles and equipment than they have ever had including over six hundred  vehicles and three  incoming helicopters there are now more opportunities for police officers to undergo training on the job to make them better prepared for work in our communities and keep us safe we are building upon and improving the capacity of the cybercrime unit to confront and neutralise the criminal and dark underbelly of modern technology and the cyberworld the government will continue to work with the management of the police service to ensure that there is proper and adequate training in modern policing methods and the equipping of the service to enable them deal with crime   mr speaker government is committed to improving the conditions of service of all security personnel including the police but nevertheless i think it is my duty also to point out that public perception of the police continues not to be the best and they must make a comprehensive effort to earn the confidence of the public we cannot run a country of law and order without a welltrained and accomplished police service that has the respect and confidence of the people i acknowledge the work they do but i urge them to work harder on their reputation  mr speaker i am happy to report that the equipping and rehabilitation effort is not only in the police service but also in all the other services as well i must make mention of the fire service and the prison service where the numbers have been increased with fresh recruitment there are positive things happening in the prison service with opportunities being made available for inmates to acquire skills   i note in particular with a lot of satisfaction that this past year three hundred and seventysix  prison inmates passed various exams in the national vocational and technical institutes junior high schools and senior high schools   mr speaker the ghana armed forces continue to perform creditably in discharging their duty of defending the territorial integrity of the country the government has retooled and equipped them to keep them in the desired state of readiness when the government amended li  which extended the runout date from twenty  years to thirty  years for the other ranks it led to the creation of new ranks within the structures of the armed forces and to a subsequent rationalisation of wages and salaries for all ranks within the forces   government is tackling the longstanding housing problem that has faced our armed forces over five hundred million cedis gh¢ million is being invested in housing projects of varying sizes for the men and women of the armed forces and in refurbishing the military academy and training schools in teshie   our soldiers have been active along the northern borders to protect our country and its people since the eruption of terrorist activities in burkina faso they have also been working with the police since july  in operation vanguard which was set up to deal with the activities of illegal miners   mr speaker the mention of operation vanguard would seem to be the appropriate time to deal with the subject of galamsey the popular name that has been coined for illegal mining when we came into office in january  galamsey activities were rampant in many parts of our country our lands forests and river bodies were being systematically degraded and polluted without any care and this had been the case for several years indeed the previous government had given up the fight against galamsey we determined that this was an intolerable situation and we owed it to generations yet unborn to tackle the problem and save our environment   i was very much aware that the lure of gold once it takes hold drives away all rationality that is not a ghanaian characteristic it is a human characteristic that has been displayed all over the world throughout the ages i was therefore not under any illusions about the size and scope of the problem we were taking on   but i was cheered by the support from a large part of the population that also recognised the danger posed by the degradation of our lands and water bodies and the needless deaths of young people who were being buried alive in makeshift mining pits i welcomed in particular the media coalition which was formed in july  that lent its support to the fight against galamsey   as i have said on countless occasions the battle we launched was not against mining it would be unrealistic for anyone to suggest that there should be no mining in ghana the almighty having blessed us with all these precious minerals must surely be in agreement that we would find ways to use them to develop our country and for the benefit of our communities   however taking the minerals out should not lead to the destruction of our water bodies and forests or endanger the sustainable existence of our country what is more it was obvious to all that the smallscale mining that had always taken place in our communities had been transformed into something unrecognisable in our history by the introduction of the monster machinery that dug up riverbeds and turned serene streams into ugly toxic muddy frothy ponds it was no longer smallscale mining and it certainly was no longer local community mining when we saw the influx of foreigners into the most rural isolated and densest of forests it was no longer local community mining when rivers hitherto considered as sacred were being abused and polluted   we started with the banning of all smallscale mining and after about a year of the campaign we made some progress as some rivers showed signs of coming back to life the university of mines and technology at tarkwa took on the role of training local people in sustainable mining and by the time the ban on all smallscale mining was lifted last year about four thousand  had received the training  this honourable house also did its part by amending the mining act to raise the penalties for illegal mining and prohibiting foreign nationals from participating in any way in smallscale mining the nation is grateful for the intervention of parliament  mr speaker the threat posed to the future of our country by galamsey is grave and we cannot shirk our responsibilities in dealing with it i am appealing to the media coalition not be daunted by the difficulties in the fight against galamsey government will not weaken its stance and welcomes the continuous support of the media coalition   the interministerial committee against illegal mining has been working hard and has had some successes under the auspices of this committee the ministry of local government has formulated and is implementing the alternative livelihood programme in thirtyfive  severely affected galamsey districts across the country  last year five hundred  youth mainly engaged in illegal mining were trained and graduated in vocational and technical skills from community development vocational and technical institutions they have been provided with startup tools and equipment an additional six hundred and seven  youth are currently undergoing similar training two hundred and forty  of whom are in the community development institutions whilst three hundred and sixtyseven  are attached to master craftsmen through apprenticeship at the community level   operation vanguard has been largely successful even though problems still remain mining with impunity on water bodies and in forest reserves has declined more than four thousand  miners have received training in sustainable mining the number of individuals dying in collapsed mining tunnels and pits in the few unauthorized locations left has reduced by more than ninety percent  operation vanguard has been particularly effective in helping to restore the order which has permitted the reopening of the famous obuasi mine of anglogold ashanti  the community mining programme has been well received by the population and young men and women who did not have the resources to acquire concessions and excavators and other mining inputs and therefore had to do galamsey have moved into legal community mining   now more than twentythousand  individuals are earning their incomes legitimately in the community mines in akrofuom atwima nwabiagya atwima mponua adansi north amansie central wassa amenfi east and wa east districts since the introduction of the community mining programme there have been no deaths due to the collapse of tunnels and pits the interministerial committee along with operation vanguard were determined to disrupt galamsey activities by confiscating equipment that were employed in these activities in this regard  changfan machines that go on the river and scoop up the riverbed were seized and destroyed on site some excavators were also seized and a number of them have gone missing the police have arrested and charged some of the alleged culprits and investigations are ongoing no one involved will be shielded no matter what their positions or political colours are   mr speaker we have made significant strides over the last three years in our fight against corruption despite the scepticism of people with questionable records we have strengthened the legal framework to fight corruption with the help of this house by passing into law the witness protection act  act  the office of the special prosecutor act  act  the right to information rti act  act  and the companies act  act  which provides a framework for enacting a beneficial ownership register  government has increased budgetary allocations to all the accountability institutions of stateincluding the parliament of ghana the judiciary chraj eoco the office of the attorneygeneral and ministry of justice the auditor general the office of the special prosecutor and the ghana police service with annual increases between  and  between  and    we have also implemented a change from the opaque allocation of ghanas oil blocks to a more transparent allocation process and advisedly so the opaque period  to  saw according to the ministry of energy the signature of thirteen  petroleum agreements from which fourteen  wells were to be drilled not a single well was drilled in contrast in my time over the last three  years there have been six  drilling campaigns on three  different blocks with others on the way we will drill more and find more oil   some forty or more  high profile personalities are currently before the courts on various corruption charges and more are in the pipeline i will like to repeat that if evidence of corruption is presented no one will be spared regardless of position or political affiliation no one is above the law that is the true meaning of equality before the law   mr speaker as part of our strategy to modernize the economy deliver government services efficiently and curb corruption government has over the last three years embarked on a major program of digitization of the economy with significant success as at the end of last week  million people have been registered for the national id card the ghana card before the end of this year ghana will have a fully working national id system which will be a gamechanger for our nation  mr speaker we are also providing infrastructure to many zongo communities across the country through the zongo development fund  mr speaker we are seeing an improvement in the quality of our nations sanitation even though we still have a lot more to do according to the northern regional environmental health unit in the three northern regions savannah north east and northern the number of open defaecation free communities odf has increased from five percent  as at june  to some fiftyeight  as at july  the latest data from the ministry of sanitation and water resources shows that odf communities in ghana as a whole have increased from four hundred and ten  in  to over five thousand  communities now that is progress and it did not just happen it took hard work commitment and the provision of infrastructure in fulfilment of our manifesto commitment of toilets for all we have built thirteen thousand eight hundred  toilets which is largely responsible for this development mr speaker we have not stopped building toilets we will build more   mr speaker another good example of deliberate wellthought out policy executed through hard work and commitment that is generating dividends is what we have done about food and agriculture in the past three  years   it bears repeating that agriculture was very much in the doldrums when we came into office with a growth rate of  we introduced the programme for planting for food and jobs and set about to make agriculture an attractive profession we invested resources expertise and time and the results have been impressive and rewarding growth rate in  was  and this increased to  last year   increased production and high yields of some foodstuffs like maize rice sorghum groundnuts soyabean cowpea cassava and plantain have led to a decrease in the wholesale prices in market centers in major food producing areas furthermore we are no longer importers of maize we are reducing our dependence on rice imports and are now in effect net exporters of foodstuffs food prices are at their lowest in decades   mr speaker i must provide some examples of what i mean by things not just occurring by happenstance but by deliberate and meticulous planning and competent execution we recruited some two thousand seven hundred  agricultural extension agents to give practical expertise on the farms we are not yet at the united nations recommended ratio of one extension officer to five hundred  farmers but we are working to get there and it is definitely a vast improvement on the decimated department we met on the assumption of office with the support of canada three hundred  vehicles and three thousand  motorbikes have been deployed around the country for ease of movement for those tasked to help the farmers   once the foodstuffs are produced we do not leave it to chance and risk not being able to sell and thereby discourage the farmers the national food and buffer stock company nafco has been revitalised to enhance agricultural marketing and improve access to market nafco is promoting institutional procurement of produce and sales to schools and hospitals   mr speaker i am pleased to inform you that the commodities exchange in ghana which is fully operational is promoting high productivity price stability increased exports and reduced imports of commodities trading operations through an electronic trading platform commenced in november    to increase storage capacity eighty  warehouses each of a size of one thousand metric tonnes are being built around the country thirtyfive  have been completed by the ministry of special development initiatives and thirteen  by the ministry of agriculture the ministry of agriculture will complete the remaining seventeen  soon and the special development initiatives ministry will complete another ten  by june in other words mr speaker every part of the value chain is planned and accounted for  the diversification of the scheme ensures that there would be something to interest a wide variety of people thus it is not only foodstuffs that are on offer the planting for export and rural development perd module promotes the following tree crops cashew coffee coconut oil palm mango rubber and shea parliament has contributed to the process of agricultural transformation by the establishment of the tree crop development authority which is going to be responsible for husbanding the industries of these tree crops into full maturity and expand by sevenfold our earnings from agriculture the rearing for food and jobs rfj programme is developing a competitive and more efficient livestock industry that will increase domestic meat production and reduce importation of livestock two hundred and sixtyfive  small earth dams have been completed under the  initiative more will be done this year   at the heart of all these efforts is the determination to make agriculture an attractive business to young educated ghanaians and this is why modernisation mechanisation and the use of technology are all part of the scheme   digital and internet maps of soil fertility status in the northern savannah ecological zone are being made available to facilitate informed decision making on fertilizer formulation and application if any more proof were needed that under this government agriculture is a hightech undertaking mr speaker an electronic platform has been established to capture and monitor the activities of participating farmers as at december  five hundred thousand  farmers had been biometrically registered   mr speaker it gives me great joy to be able to tell this house that modernisation is finally coming to the fishing industry as well new ways of doing things are being accepted and our fisherfolk are now ready to take a leap into scientific and sustainable methods of fishing for two consecutive years now our fisherfolk have accepted a close season and allowed fishes to spawn without disturbance in our waters constructions of the ten  long promised much publicised landing sites in senya beraku elmina moree mumford winneba gomoa fetteh dixcove axim teshie and keta have finally started axim dixcove senya beraku and gomoa fetteh will be completed by the end of this year with the remainder being completed early next year construction of the jamestown harbour will commence in march following the completion of technical work   mr speaker i am looking forward to the business resource centres being built helping the country to unearth some exciting young entrepreneurs thirtyseven  of them have been completed these centres are onestop enterprise support centres that provide full range of business development services investment facilitation and information services to entrepreneurs and business enterprises at the district level on monday i was very pleased to be at kadjebi in the oti region to commission one  of the thirtyseven  brcs that have been completed around the country in november last year i commissioned another one at effiduase asokore in the ashanti region the brcs are all being equipped with modern it infrastructure and networked through a virtual private network to facilitate efficient delivery of their operations we have built thirtyseven  we are building thirty  more  the young people that i met during the presidential pitch programme for example give me a lot of hope and strike me as having the potential to benefit from the brcs the national entrepreneurship and innovations plan and take on the world  mr speaker the government is aggressively pursuing its plans for industrial transformation whilst the business development ministry works on bringing out entrepreneurial skills and encouraging young people to spot business opportunities we are paying greater attention to making ghana an easy place to do business and set up industries   having won the bid to host the headquarters of the african continental free trade area afcfta in accra the government has provided a permanent office building to host the secretariat and with the appointment of the secretarygeneral in addis ababa two weeks ago at the recent au summit the office will become operational by the end of next month we extend our warm congratulations to the first secretarygeneral wamkele mene the young south african and assure him that we will give him our fullest cooperation to ensure he succeeds  mr speaker we launched the ghana automotive development policy in august last year and it has so far attracted investments and commercial interests from some very big players including toyota volkswagen nissan renault hyundai sinotruk and suzuki vw is building its plant at the north industrial area in accra and is due to start production by the end of april sinotruk has begun assembling its trucks toyota is scheduled to start the assembly of vehicles in tema in the last quarter of this year we have high hopes for this new industry which has come to join our own kantanka  mr speaker we are determined at long last to exploit our large bauxite manganese and iron ore deposits which will enable us to establish an integrated bauxite and aluminium industry and an iron and steel industry the ghana integrated bauxite and aluminum development corporation and the ghana integrated iron and steel corporation have been established by law as the vehicles for this exploitation the processes are underway for the selection this year of joint venture partners for the development of the full value chain of these two multibilliondollar industries which will give a tremendous boost to ghanaian industrialisation   mr speaker all our best laid plans for industrialization would come to naught unless we have a reliable and reasonably priced energy source it probably says something about the progress we have made that in discussing the state of our nation it takes a while even to get into our power supply matters it gives me great pleasure to be able to say that we have overcome the dumsor menace but unfortunately i cannot say that we have resolved all our energy problems it is still work in progress further the five years of energy crisis led to the signing of what can only be described as usurious contracts that have landed our country with a huge financial burden the take or pay contracts resulted in the country being saddled with expensive excess power and our having to pay nearly one billion united states dollars in  and  for power we did not need we are working to find a way out to ensure reliable power supply at a cost that makes us competitive in the region   in the meantime the industrialisation flagship project  is progressing and beginning to show dividends a total of one hundred and eightyone  projects spread across the one hundred and twelve  districts are currently at various stages of implementation under the programme fiftyeight  companies already in operation twentysix  projects currently under construction fiftyeight  afdb smallscale projects ready for sod cutting in the early part of this year and twentysix  pipeline projects are ready to commence implementation by the  quarter of this year exim bank last month signed a one hundred million united states dollar facility with credit suisse to help complete this year twenty  of the exportrelated factories it is envisaged that the  initiative will generate a total of two hundred and twentyeight thousand eight hundred and sixtysix  direct and indirect jobs even though the latest ghana living standards survey has recorded a drop in unemployment from  in  to  in  we still need to do more to create more jobs with urgency  struggling existing businesses are also being revived and expanded under the  scheme there is nothing contrary to the philosophy that underpins  if an already existing enterprise is helped to expand and employ more people   mr speaker all our plans all our hopes all our expectations for a brighter tomorrow will only come to fruition if we can guarantee an educated and skilled workforce a look at the national budget gives a clear indication of where our priority lies and it is with education   the pretertiary education bill currently before parliament defines the priorities basic education has been redefined to include senior high school and this covers vocational agricultural and technical schools the emphasis is aggressively to promote science technology engineering and mathematics education across all levels of the education system i am aware that some of the teacher unions have concerns over the proposed legislation i would like to add my voice to that of parliament in encouraging the unions to deepen their engagement with the ministry of education in order to find a consensus that will enable the bill to go forward in peace   mr speaker it was a manifesto commitment to leverage technology to popularise the teaching and learning of mathematics it was with an eye to the future that we decided to demystify mathematics and make ghana a mathematicsfriendly country we need more engineering and technically minded people to be able to transform the economy i am glad to report that ghanas teachers are supportive of the many changes that are being introduced to make these hopes a reality yes the first cohort of free shs students are now getting ready to take their west african senior secondary certificate examination and we look forward to them doing well   despite the continuing hostility of a few about the merits of the free senior high school policy i am glad to note that it has been widely accepted by the overwhelming majority of ghanaians yes we still have some difficulties with infrastructure deficits which are being vigourously addressed with the construction of nine hundred and sixty two  facilities – dormitories dining halls assembly halls and classroom blocks together with the provision of mono desks and beds – but the argument about the importance of ensuring that all ghanas children get a secondary school education is irresistible   in the best of worlds the conversation should move on to the fastest way to provide laboratories and workshops to make all ghanas children ict competent the conversation should move on to how quickly we can transform our children into technicallyminded and mathematics loving students   this government is trying to move the conversation to technical vocational and education training tvet becoming the instinctive choice for children at school we are moving the conversation to ensuring that when an institution is designated as a technical institution it delivers technical courses and just in case i need to remind anyone tvet has always been part of free shs or if you prefer call it free tvet   i am well aware that we need a happy and contented group of teachers to ensure that the teaching and learning environment is happy and safe for our children we have restored the teacher trainee allowances employed sixtyseven thousand  teachers paid  pension funds of teachers cleared the threeyear backlog of nonpromotion of teachers abandoned the threemonth pay policy we inherited for newlyrecruited teachers and cleared  of the legacy arrears we have restored the research and book allowances that were cancelled and we have agreed to grant teachers a professional allowance the new promotion policy for teachers announced some two weeks ago has been well received by teachers this government is determined to restore dignity to the teaching profession we want the teachers to accept that they hold our destinies in their hands   i am happy to note that sporting activities are finding their way back into the regular school curriculum i am told that interschools sporting activities are once again attaining the keen competitive edge that those of us of a certain age remember   mr speaker ten  youth and sports centres of excellence are being constructed across ten regions of the country at wa dormaa dunkwaonoffin ho koforidua nyinahin yendi navrongo axim and kaneshie to harness and develop the entrepreneurial abilities and sporting talents of the youth all ten  will be completed this year and the six  newly created regions will also be provided with the same facilities from this year each centre will have a counselling centre for entrepreneurship development a conference centre an ict centre a restaurant hostel facility and offices a fifa standard football pitch an  athletic track tennis courts multipurpose courts for basketball handball tennis volleyball and other sporting disciplines and a gymnasium   we are making sure there will be room for the future alice anums mike aheys baba yaras to develop their skills we want to make sure that when children turn on the television to watch sporting programmes they will be able to find on the field and tracks ghanaians competing at the highest levels  it was with considerable reluctance that government had to intervene in the administration of football when we decided to dissolve the old gfa because of the bribery and corruption that engulfed its operation government worked with fifa established the normalisation committee and helped bring a new gfa into being i am happy to note that football the passion of the nation has returned to full normalcy following the election of a new president of the ghana football association gfa mr kurt okraku i congratulate him on his election the ghana premier league has started and let us help bring back the love   mr speaker this year we are going to conduct a national census and it is incumbent on every citizen to cooperate with the ghana statistical service to enable the service produce an accurate census and data for our effective socioeconomic planning   mr speaker we never lose sight of the fact that there are always some people who might not be able to run lifes race at the same frenetic pace as the majority of people it is the responsibility of government always to provide the safety net that would ensure that the poor and vulnerable are not excluded from the development agenda   we will continue to improve and expand social protection interventions to cover those who need them it is critical that the social protection interventions are targeted at those who genuinely need them and who would use them to help lift themselves out of poverty   mr speaker the ghana national household registry gnhr in collaboration with the ghana statistical service is collecting data on all extremely poor households in the country through interinstitutional coordination to ensure efficiency and effectiveness in social protection spending and eliminate duplication in targeting and selection of beneficiaries for social protection programmes   mr speaker let me give an example of the type of help for the first time in the countrys history a dedicated fund of five million cedis gh¢ million to support women entrepreneurs with disability has been established  the fund known as presidential empowerment for women entrepreneurs with disability is to provide financial support to one thousand  women entrepreneurs with disability in two years either to establish or scaleup their businesses so far eight hundred and fifty  women entrepreneurs with disability across the country have benefitted from the fund which is fifty percent  grant and fifty percent  loan without interest the support has enabled the women to expand their businesses and to create one hundred and eighty  direct jobs and many more indirect jobs  the presidential empowerment for women entrepreneurs with disability does not only help deliver a manifesto commitment it is also in fulfilment of the sdg goals five  eight  and ten  which aim to ensure economic inclusion of women and to harness their talents and capabilities for national development   mr speaker we have begun the process of amending the disability act act  to comply with the united nations convention on the rights of persons with disabilities and hopefully this house will pass it before the end of the year as part of the disability inclusive policy of government all metropolitan municipal and district assemblies have representations of persons with disabilities to enable them partake in local level governance   mr speaker the general health of the people is an important ingredient in making rapid development sixtyfive thousand  new healthcare personnel from  to date have been recruited the national health insurance scheme is operating more adequately and is enjoying the confidence of the increasing numbers of its users with the number of active members up from  million in  to  million at the end of  i remember last year i urged ghanaians to renew their nhis membership by dialling star nine two nine hash  on any mobile phone network i am glad it has had an impact as five million people renewed their nhis membership through the mobile renewal service platform in    as the nation has made progress in eradicating the communicable diseases that used to be the main causes of mortality we are in danger of falling into the lifestyle disease trap too many of us are overweight and obesity is an increasing problem even among young people the foods we eat the mode of cooking and the lack of exercise are all now having a great impression on our health it is time we all learn to take responsibility for our individual health and accept that our health is very much determined by our lifestyle   mr speaker one big problem we have is how we move people and goods from place to place i am glad to report that we are making significant and verifiable progress in the railways sector we can now take for granted and as part of the normal transportation routes the rehabilitation of some of the old narrowgauge lines that have been pressed back into service the tema to accra line has been operational for two years and the accra to nsawam line would soon be the takoradi to tarkwa line was inaugurated few weeks ago and is proving to be very popular and being enthusiastically patronised   mr speaker there are other suburban lines that will soon be brought into our everyday lives those are exciting of course but the big one remains the tema to ouagadougou or to put it less dramatically the accra to paga line what started as the tema to paga railway line has become the ghana to burkina railway interconnectivity project approximately eight hundred  kilometers of this rail line will be in ghana and two hundred  kilometers in burkina faso   mr speaker cabinet has approved the final route for this line the approximately one hundred  kilometre tema to akwamu mkapadan line is the first section of the tema to ouagadougou rail line at the environs of juapong a branch line from tema to mpakadan will continue through hohoe nkwanta dambai yendi tamale walewale nalerigu sheini bolgatanga and then to paga as the remaining seven hundred  kilometers of the tema to ouagadougou railway line   mr speaker the consultants of the project have submitted their final report and the two governments have begun the final stage of procurement for the strategic investor i am confident that this year the strategic investor will be chosen the preparation for construction has already commenced with the choice of the final route and the acquisition of land the right of way will start immediately   the contractors have assured the government that the tema to mpakadan line which includes a three hundred  metre rail bridge over the volta river will be completed in august those who travel along the accra to akosombo route would testify that this is a reality as we can all see the work being done i hope to travel on that line in august we can safely say that the rail line journey to paga has begun   work is going on to develop the railway network in other parts of the country there will be activity on the eastern line this year and construction will commence on the kumasi to nyinahin via aduadin rail line in addition to the intercity and regional railway lines government is committed to developing suburban rail lines and innercity light rail to ease the oppressive traffic situation within our cities   what is popularly referred to as the western line is receiving attention the kojokrom to manso section approximately twentytwo  kilometre section of the line with a three hundred and fifty  metre viaduct is being developed   to speed up the development of the line the contractor has been asked to develop a new standard gauge line within the port of takoradi to convert the takoradi to kojokrom narrow gauge line into a standard gauge line and also to continue the development of the new standard gauge line from manso to huni valley   the kumasi section of the western line will also receive attention this year since government has decided to develop the western line from takoradi towards kumasi and from kumasi towards takoradi mr speaker i am happy to announce that development of the kumasi to aduabin section of the western line will commence this year    mr speaker just in case there is someone here who might have missed it i would like to announce and inform the house that this year the year of our lord  has been declared the year of roads   mr speaker when we declared last year  as the year of return it was not because africans in the diaspora had not been visiting ghana throughout the years to reconnect with their past we wanted to make a special year of it we wanted to draw attention to it and inform the whole world we considered it important that is the idea of the year of roads  there are legitimate cases to be made for emphasis to be placed on any of the many deficits in our infrastructure this year this government is saying we are putting the emphasis on roads   gradually the backlog of debts owed to contractors is being cleared and many of them are able to go back to the jobs to finish them   a list of some critical roads has been drawn up and work has started on them some of the names of the roads on this list have featured repeatedly in various speeches before this house in the past thirty years some of them have even featured on lists of roads that have been claimed to have been built but that have turned out to have been artists impressions some of the roads on the list have indeed been said to have been built by socalled reputable contractors but they have not survived two rainy seasons   mr speaker i speak for all of us in this house when i say the most frequent and most passionate complaints we get from our constituents are about roads   i therefore expect that everyone will take an interest in the works that are being done and going to be done let us all take an interest and ensure that we get value for money never again should it be that a political party or government be allowed to claim to have built a road a school or a hospital when they have not done so no longer should it be permissible that project supervisors and consultants sign off on buildings and roads for contractors to be paid for shoddy work or work not done   we live in these communities where these fake projects are said to have been undertaken and we should each make it our business to ensure that the work is what it claims to be and contractors get paid for work they have indeed done the ministry has published the list of critical roads that the government is undertaking to do and i shall not be reciting them here i am sure we all have our favourite among the list   however i would mention a few the upgrading of the atebubukwame danso kwadwokrom road and this would be in honour of our former chief justice justice sophia akuffo who once gave me a hairraising account of a trip she took on that road the second choice i make is the hohoejasikandodo pepeso stretch we shall all be greatly relieved when it is finally done there are others such as benchemankwantaadjayfua bolgatangabawku kumasi and greater accra inner city roads and this is the first time that four  flyovers and interchanges are being constructed at the same time in our history  mr speaker i am sure that like the year of return which after its success has now been declared by some as the decade of return we would be declaring a decade of roads until we get a road network that meets the needs of a modern industrialised ghana  mr speaker one of the major beneficiaries of the year of return was the creative arts industry our commitment to the development of ghanas creative arts industry is absolute i inaugurated in december last year the national film authority whose function is to supervise an economically selfsustaining and culturally conscious film industry in the country the creative arts industry bill has been presented to cabinet for consideration and once passed by parliament the act will establish the creative arts fund and an agency to promote the industry government has also reaffirmed its commitment to the growth of the industry by commencing the construction of the very first senior high school in ghana dedicated solely to the development of the industry i cut the sod for this construction in kumasi again in december last year we are determined to do more   mr speaker we have a good story to tell in many areas once derelict state enterprises have been revitalised let me list a few state housing company ghana publishing corporation ghana post gihoc state transport company ghana maritime authority have all been given a new lease of life and are functioning with greater efficiency and becoming again profit centres  digitisation has also led to a remarkable improvement in the delivery of public services we are all greatly relieved for example that the hassle has been removed for those who want to get passports we are equally relieved that dvla offices are no longer the nightmare places they used to be and we can get drivers licences without having to go through goro boys i have not had the experience myself yet but i am assured that the stc has been transformed and it is now a pleasant experience to travel on their buses   ssnit has given a guarantee that when people apply for their pensions they would get them within two weeks i am told most people get them within ten days a far cry from the sad disgraceful and humiliating experience that pensioners used to go through to get their pensions   we have implemented a digital property address system which gives an address to every location in ghana we now have the first of its kind mobile money interoperability payment system in africa the port operates a paperless clearance system business registration is now online we can now buy electricity units on our mobile phones and ejustice system has been implemented at the courts this process of digitisation is also helping to curb corruption   mr speaker for the first time in many years ghana has a fully functioning emergency response and ambulance system as promised government has procured three hundred and seven  ambulances with one assigned to each constituency each ambulance has a tracker that determines its location instantly from the command centre the emergency number oneonetwo  has also been linked to the ghanapost gps system such that if any call to the number is made using the ghanapost gps app emergency services will know the exact location of the caller instantly   we are employing drones to deliver emergency medical supplies in remote areas and today ghana has the largest medical drone delivery service in the world   mr speaker when the electoral commission begins the registration exercise for the compilation of a new voters register in the course of the year i appeal to all ghanaians to register it is our civic responsibility   ghana mr speaker as she has done periodically since  is going to conduct on  december a general election so that our people can choose the person and persons they want to manage the affairs of the nation on their behalf this will be the eighth  general election of our history in the  republic government together with all stakeholders is determined to ensure that it is peaceful and orderly so that our people can make their choice in freedom and serenity and exercise their civic duty of helping to elect a government of their choice on  december we should all commit ourselves to uphold the reputation of our nation as a beacon of democracy and we expect the media to help lead the way in that regard    mr speaker despite the achievements of this government some of which i have outlined i hasten to add that we still have some way to go to reach the ghana we want three years ago when i first stood before you i said and i quote i was not elected by the overwhelming majority of the ghanaian people to complain i was elected to get things done i was elected to fix what is broken and my government and i are determined to do just that mr speaker we have done just that we have fixed the broken economy we have delivered free senior high school education we have brought the national health insurance scheme back to life we have revamped our agriculture we have sanitised the banking sector our industrial transformation is on we are digitising the economy and ghana continues to be at peace we have done much more than we inherited we are creating conditions for young people to have hope again and we are determined to do more things are working in ghana and ghana is surely changing   mr speaker our nation is in good health and in good competent hands  may god bless us all and our homeland ghana and make her great and strong  i thank you for your attention      ghana is a west african country bound on the north by burkina faso on the east by togo on the south by the atlantic

      "address by the president of the republic nana addo dankwa akufoaddo at the may day celebration on friday  may  workers of ghana i am happy to be able to join you on this special day set aside to celebrate workers across the world may day which is annually the occasion for energetic enthusiastic parades and joyful celebrations to acknowledge and pay tribute to the great contribution the toil of working people make to the lives of societies and nations  unfortunately this years celebration is a muted one because of the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic which is affecting all the nations of the world that is why we are having to commemorate this years special occasion in the studios of ghana broadcasting corporation instead of independence square and i am glad that the secretarygeneral of the tuc dr yaw baah invited me to be a part of this celebration which is being held in this unique manner it was an invitation i could not turn down because we have to commemorate may day whatever the circumstances gbc is to be warmly commended for assisting in this initiative so let me on behalf of government and the people of ghana wish all workers a happy may day celebration we recognise and appreciate the efforts and sacrifices you have made towards the construction of the happy and prosperous ghana we seek and on this day i say a big ayekoo to each one of you since i became president on  january  some three and a half years ago i am glad to state that the relationship between government and organised labour has been one of cordiality cooperation and mutual respect i continue to be reassured by the determination of organised labour and its leadership to rally behind government to create a progressive nation buoyed on by faster economic growth rates and driven by the quest for decent jobs i have been heartened by this and i am determined for as long as i remain president of the republic to continue even more firmly on this path of coopetration and collaboration on which we have embarked workers of ghana job creation is one of the most important priorities of this government it is the thrust of the social contract and over the course of our stay in government we have taken bold innovative and urgent steps to realising this indeed the latest ghana living standards survey states that the rate of unemployment which stood at  in  dropped to  in  by the same token our gdp has been growing over the last three years at an average of seven percent  per year up from the  we inherited in  ghana in this period has become the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in west africa all this because our macroeconomy has been considerably strengthened however recent events have threatened to derail the progress we have made as a nation that is why i believe the theme for this years celebration  in ghana impact on employment and working conditions is apt as it puts into sharp focus the exigencies of our time and the work each and every one has to do to get our nation fully back to work the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in our country has meant that government has rapidly had to implement a number of measures to help stem the tide of the spread as i indicated in my  address to the nation my singleminded goal is how to protect our population from the virus see to the rebuilding of our economy and steer the country out of this crisis some of the measures implemented like those of  of march have decreed the suspension of all public gatherings and the closure of our schools and borders these measures are still very much in force which means that this year we are not gathered at independence square we have also reviewed some of the measures and lifted the restrictions to movement of persons resident in accra tema kumasi and takoradi two weeks ago when i invited the leadership of the trades union congress to jubilee house we discussed at length what impact the virus and the measures to contain it have had on businesses and the welfare of workers in the words of the admirable tuc secretarygeneral dr yaw baah and i quote what we are seeing is mindboggling businesses are collapsing in almost all the sectors of the economy many people have already lost their jobs and many more would have lost their jobs without the easing of these restrictions in spite of this stark assessment i was encouraged by his statement that the fight against  is a shared responsibility and i want to stress once again that together we will defeat this virus  like virtually all other countries ghana has not been spared the adverse effects of the pandemic with the international labour organisation ilo estimating that  billion workers in the world have been affected by the imposition of partial and full lockdowns preliminary data available to us in ghana indicates that the impact of the virus on our economy has been dire indeed no sector of our economy has been spared by the pandemic the bank of ghana tells us that the virus will have a negative impact on exports imports taxes foreign investments and foreign exchange receipts with gdp growth rate estimated at  percent in a worsecase scenario the virus has also resulted in reduced productivity job losses and steep decline in revenues for government businesses households and individuals should the pandemic persist for much longer we could face an uphill battle in trying to minimise its effects on the growth and development of our economy and in ameliorating the suffering of our workers the poor and the vulnerable as government and as social partners it is our collective responsibility to chart our own course out of this pandemic onto a path of sustained growth progress and prosperity which will safeguard jobs and ensure the safety of the population it is obvious that a weak response to the threat of  would jeopardise the gains made to create a buoyant economy and will worsen the lives and livelihoods of all ghanaians so we have put in place a resilience and recovery plan hinged on the coronavirus alleviation programme to support businesses and households with the overarching aim to ensure economic activity and sustained livelihoods and on the one billion dollar imf rapid credit facility to help close the financing gap that has been created as a result of shortfalls in revenues together with unbudgeted additional expenditures equivalent discussions are ongoing with the world bank to raise more funds which should be completed soon i have charged the ministry of finance to work with the bank of ghana to design innovative policies and find more resources to strengthen the productive sectors of the economy particularly industry and agriculture and i understand that the process will shortly yield positive results the minister for finance and his south african counterpart are leading the efforts of african ministers for finance to obtain debt relief for our economies the world bank through the ida has granted a debt repayment standstill for the next nine  months which will result in our delaying principal and interest payments totalling five hundred million dollars  million to create greater fiscal space to promote our economy i have also asked the ministers for finance trade and industry food and agriculture and the chief executive of the ghana investment promotion centre gipc to create a futureproof resilient plan consistent with the principles of ghana beyond aid through the gh¢ billion coronavirus alleviation programme government ensured the provision of hot meals and dry food packages to over four hundred thousand vulnerable families and has absorbed for three months the water bills of all ghanaians and the electricity bills of all lifeline customers and provided a  subsidy for all other customers we have also instituted a comprehensive incentive package to help motivate our health workers who are the heroes and heroines of our struggle government has taken other measures it has extended the tax filing date from april to june through negotiations with the banks we have ensured a two percent  reduction of interest rates by banks effective last month and additionally the banks have granted a six  month moratorium of principal repayments to entities in the airline and hospitality industries ie hotels restaurants car rentals food vendors taxis and uber operators further in collaboration with the national board for small scale industries nbssi business  trade associations and selected commercial and rural banks government will from this month of may roll out a soft loan scheme up to a total of six hundred million cedis gh¢ million to support micro small and medium scale businesses loans disbursed will have a oneyear moratorium and twoyear repayment period the decision by the commercial banks with the support of the bank of ghana to institute a three billion cedi gh¢ billion credit and stimulus package to help revitalise industries especially in the pharmaceutical hospitality services and manufacturing sectors is one i very much welcome workers of ghana the onset of this virus has not only led to job losses but has also revealed the ingenuity and cando spirit of the ghanaian thereby creating jobs it has stimulated our capacity to produce for ourselves and is making us depend on the things we make and grow for our own survival this is a clear manifestation of our potential to be able to move this country to a situation of selfsufficiency out of adversity comes opportunity the veronica bucket has won universal acclaim for its inventiveness ghanaian scientists are working on the discovery of an african vaccine to counter the virus and of a testkit suitable for our conditions today we are able to produce in increasingly large quantities sanitizers and essential personal protective equipment required by our healthcare workers to fight the virus we have to do even more it has also led to a paradigm shift in work management protocols and the mainstreaming of digital technology in all aspects of our working lives to this end i have directed the minister for employment and labour relations to lead a national dialogue on the future of work to fashion out a national strategy so we are not taken by events such as this pandemic in the future  let me state that government will intensify the implementation of the fourpoint national strategy on formalisation to facilitate the identification and provision of support relief and stimulus packages to businesses and workers in these difficult times i also assure organised labour that government will continue to deepen its engagement with them as we try to mitigate the adverse impact of  on the economy businesses and jobs at this stage i implore each and every one of you just as we have done over the last couple of months to continue to sacrifice so that we do not have to bear a greater cost in the future all sections of society must see this sacrifice as a common effort to defeat this common enemy before i conclude i have to provide you with a current update on our fight against the pandemic as at yesterday we have conducted a total of one hundred and thirteen thousand four hundred and ninetyseven  tests the most per million people of any country in africa with two thousand and seventyfour  testing positive our recoveries have increased from one hundred and eightyeight  to two hundred and twelve  and the number of deaths sadly stands at seventeen  our positivity rate has gone up marginally from  to  six  persons are critically ill and one thousand eight hundred and thirtynine  persons are well and responding to treatment in health facilities or are being managed from home this in effect means that there is presently no big pressure on our healthcare facilities to manage these cases we pray to god it stays that way  steps at increasing further our testing capacity have been taken with the coming on stream of the veterinary laboratory in accra the centre for scientific and industrial research laboratory also in accra the university of health and allied sciences in ho and the veterinary laboratory in pongtamale to aid the labours of the noguchi research institute the kumasi centre for collaborative research and the national public health reference laboratory at the korlebu teaching hospital a number of isolation quarantine and treatment facilities have also been identified across the country for use the nation is profoundly grateful to the church of pentecost for the generous christian gesture of making available its multipurpose convention centre at gomoa fetteh as an isolation centre which can house over one thousand  persons and three hundred  medical staff it is important for every ghanaian to note that the more people we test for the virus the more persons we will discover as positive and thus have the opportunity to isolate and treat them the implementation of this strategy of tracing testing and treating is our surest way of rooting out the virus as i have stated time and again all the measures put in place to combat the spread of the disease are under constant review and government will not hesitate to cordon impose a curfew trace test and treat persons in communities where we are witnessing significant spread of infections i will continue to urge all of us to continue to practice social distancing wash our hands with soap under running water refrain from shaking hands and wear our masks whenever we leave our homes businesses and other workplaces should operate and observe staff management and workplace protocols of social distancing this applies equally forcefully to public transport operators and users of our market places we must observe these measures religiously as they are the weapons of our battle against the virus with the suspension of all public gatherings still in force and our schools closed government has taken the decision to extend further the closure of our borders for a month effective  on monday  may until sunday  may we know that the overwhelming majority of positive cases came from travellers or contacts of travellers so we have no option but to keep our borders closed until we are confident that we have put in place measures to prevent travellers from importing the virus these restrictions cannot and will not be a permanent feature of our lives but they are for now essential to our survival as i said last sunday i shall be outlining shortly the steps for systematically easing the restrictive measures to bring us back to normality  but i would plead with you – stop the stigmatisation of recovered persons – as it will rather drive people away from getting screened tested and treated the stigmatisation of recovered persons must not go on because if the virus did not end their lives and livelihoods the stigma from members of their communities should not the overwhelming majority of them will continue to live perfectly normal lives and cease to be sources of infections workers of ghana the role of organised labour during our national struggle for freedom and independence from the british colonial power is written in letters of gold the historic call for positive action in  made by our first president kwame nkrumah would not have succeeded without the active support of the trades union movement then led by the legendary trades unionists pobee biney and vidal quist in the postindependent era organised labour has continued to play a very constructive part in the development of our country today our nation requires its active involvement in this fight against the pandemic and i call upon all working people to step forward again i am confident that together if we remain united and resolute and maintain discipline and selfdiscipline we shall defeat this virus this too shall pass for the battle is the lords once again i wish you a happy may day celebration even if a restrained one may god bless all ghanaian workers and us all and may god bless our homeland ghana and make her great and strong i thank you for your attention    ghana is a west african country bound on the north by burkina faso on the east by togo on the south by the

      "acceptance speech by the president of the republicnana addo dankwa akufoaddoat the new patriotic partys acclamation ceremony at alisa hotel accra on saturday  june  my dear friends and colleagues these indeed are not normal times  here we are at what should have been a crowded happy even riotous climax to our internal party elections that would take us to the general elections in december instead of the loud jam packed gatherings that we know we have been reduced to the social distance correct roomful of one hundred  people thanks to technology i know that we have been joined by hundreds of thousands of our supporters at home and abroad who are able to follow the events as they happen first lady vice president second lady president kufuor mr chairman general secretary chairman of the council of elders members of the national council officials of the new patriotic party i must confess this is a rare experience for me in my long political career and i am not talking of the acclamation by social distance i refer to the fact that any time i have run for any office i have had to go through a long often bruising battle and this is only the second time that i have not been contested once at the parliamentary level and this the second at the presidential i am glad to add this to my portfolio of political experiences but most of all i must express my heartfelt thanks to all members of our party across the length and breadth of the country and abroad and to the party office holders who are responsible for the process that leads to the election of the presidential candidate for our party thank you for the belief and confidence you have showed in me thank you for your trust in me to lead our party to an unquestionable and resounding victory at the elections in december just as we did four  years ago in december  i do not take your trust lightly i come to this moment with great humility and with deep gratitude to almighty god who has bestowed this exceptional honour on my modest self the leadership of the new patriotic party imposes a scared trust our forefathers right from the beginning of formal politics in this country made an unspoken pact with the people to treat them with respect and if given the opportunity to govern to do so with honesty and dedication at a moment like this my mind goes to our leaders throughout the ages and i feel strongly the weight of responsibility that comes from continuing to step in the shoes of george pa grant joseph boakye danquah emmanuel obetsebilamptey edward akufoaddo simon diedong dombo kofi abrefa busia victor owusu william oforiatta albert adu boahen and others like baffuor osei akoto men who showed exemplary leadership in defining moments of ghanas history and of course in every sense of the word into the giant shoes of the  president of the  republic his excellency john agyekum kufuor whose outstanding tenure took ghana to a whole new level i have no choice but to use the inspiration that comes from invoking their names to lead our party and the people of ghana with dedication today there are some among us in this country who would take for granted the idea of a democratic ghana and would make light of the rights and obligations that come with living in a democracy if you are a leader of the npp if you are a member or supporter of the npp you would know that every inch of democratic space was fought for and sometimes died for in this country our fourth republican constitution is crafted on multiparty democracy we did not get there by chance it took a long and difficult battle today some take it for granted the multiplicity of media outlets and the freedom of the press these did not become part of our governance landscape by happenstance it took a long and difficult battle waged largely by the political tradition to which we belong to get our nation to where we are today friends and colleagues i recall some of our battles not as a boast but because it bears reminding all of us where we came from and more importantly to remind us in the npp of the heavy responsibility we carry we know what we stand for the rule of law freedom of speech and of the press individual freedoms the determination to liberate the energies of the people for the growth of a propertyowning democracy to build an economy that will create wealth for all our people and not just for the elite few i need to remind everybody that ours has been the only political tradition in this country that has espoused the development of the country and of the individual as part of our foundational beliefs hence our motto development in freedom whenever we have had the opportunity to govern we have been guided by these longheld principles that is who we are we have been consistent it is in our dna and we dare not and would not stray from them in the three and a half years that it has been my abiding privilege to lead this party in government we have kept our eyes firmly on these beliefs all our flagship programmes are rooted in the effort to liberate the energies of the people to grow an economy of which all the people can be part in spite of the truly abysmal state in which we found the economy of ghana in january  we can be proud of what we have been able to achieve in the past three and a half years we are not there yet we are not where we want ghana to be and we are very much aware of the amount of work that remains to be done we have demonstrated though beyond any shadow of doubt our competence in the management of the national economy since without competence we cannot improve on the welfare of the masses we have also certainly changed the outlook on education in this country free shs has brought relief to many homes and secondary education is no longer the preserve of children whose parents have the means to pay their way free tvet means that young people can learn for free technical and vocational skills that set them up for life the first cohort of the young people to have benefited from this brave and forwardlooking policy graduate soon and we only have to persist for a few more years and we would see ghana change before our very eyes we would have an educated workforce we would have a betterinformed population and we would be better placed to compete in the world we are investing in the future of ghana and it is to the benefit of every home in the country  we have been busy in the delivery of physical infrastructure as well and i am happy to report that after just three and a half years in office i can say without any fear of contradiction that every constituency in this country has seen the provision of some basic infrastructure to their communities in other words we have not limited the construction and building of infrastructure to the cities but our towns and villages are seeing development as well because we do not believe in leaving any community out of the development programme of ghana the provision of water toilets warehouses to store agricultural produce are all helping to improve the look of the rural areas of our country we have not stopped at water for all and toilet for all we are pursuing infrastructure for all our approach is different we owe it to ghana to be different the huge investments we are making in agriculture mean ghana will soon be a selfsufficient nation in food production the need to be selfsufficient has been demonstrated dramatically in this most trying year for the whole world the arrival of the novel coronavirus has taught all of us that we have to be selfreliant which has been my mantra since i took office in advocating the objective of a ghana beyond aid the pandemic has emphasised the fact that living on edge living on a day to day economy is too precarious and we all must have some buffer of protection in all aspects of our lives the pandemic also brought out some of the best in the ghanaian and i have been touched by the sense of community that many people have displayed in looking out for each other unfortunately the pandemic has also exposed some very unpleasant aspects of our lives some of these difficulties like the lack of adequate health infrastructure the government has determined to do something about as quickly as possible we are embarking on a vigorous hospital building project aimed at making sure all parts of the country are adequately provided the pandemic has also showed all of us the important role of good leadership in the management of the affairs of human beings there are no hiding places when a pandemic is abroad i thank the almighty that i have had a hardworking team to support me as we have grappled with the management of the virus in our country since march we did not plan for this unthinkable crisis but we did prepare our economy well for tougher times and we can build it stronger for you the ghanaian people when this is all over my dear friends and colleagues this past weekend our party came to the end of the processes that we have to go through to prepare for the elections in december with the primaries in constituencies where we have sitting mps unfortunately in our enthusiasm and sheer unbridled joy we broke some of the  safety protocols it should not happen again i congratulate all those who came out winners and have got the opportunity to represent our party at the elections in december as always happens during elections there were losers many of these people are important personalities in our party and are playing critical roles in parliament as are all the others but those of us in politics know that these things happen we know that to use the famous words of our onetime general secretary we have to continue to fear delegates but we remain firm in our belief that losing one election cannot and does not mean the end of your political life i am a living example i urge all of us to get over our disappointments quickly and unite to go before the country this was the message i gave to the fortytwo  mps who lost when i invited them to meet with me at jubilee house on thursday i believe that the message went down well especially if we recollect the impressive words several of them uttered after their defeat we have a good story to tell and we should go out to tell it on every sector of our lives we should show the difference between the npp way of tackling problems and the way our opponents do it we grow the economy they shrink the economy we create the properly regulated enabling atmosphere for businesses to flourish they allow chancers and speculators to lure citizens into putting their monies in dodgy enterprises they bring our banks and financial services to near collapse and we have to clean up shore up and restore confidence they plunge us into dumsor we keep the lights on they look on clueless as hundreds of thousands of ghanas children exit school at jhs we bring free shs and free tvet to prepare our children better to face life they resort to crude language when faced with difficult arguments we raise the level of public discourse we owe it to ourselves and to ghana to win the elections in december decisively to make sure that we keep the economy on track and not in the hands of people who will run it into the ground again demagogic pronouncements about your socalled love of the masses do not put food on the table do not send the child to school do not guarantee access to good healthcare do not assure the pensioner the value of his pension we do not believe in pitting the rich against the poor or the poor against the rich we believe in helping every ghanaian to climb up the ladder of progress and we have been consistent in this not just in words but in deeds we are told that those who were responsible for the worst economic performance of the last thirty  years have learnt their lessons and seek another opportunity to correct their mistakes dare i ask – should the presidency be for experiments surely not you the ghanaian people deserve better and you will get better on  december with four  more years for nana and the npp to do more for you  we have to win the election to see our many projects through to conclusion we dare not leave the many factories coming up under our  scheme to be truncated we dare not leave the free shs to be reviewed we dare not leave our roads to go unattended again only to become part of a green book propaganda we dare not jeopardise the digitization schedule on which we have embarked i urge you therefore my dear friends and colleagues to go out with the confidence that comes from your government performing well and running the affairs of the country competently tell our story to the ghanaian people and tell it often last thursday the supreme court presided over by the chief justice by a unanimous decision of the sevenmember panel settled all the issues surrounding the voters register and affirmed the right of the electoral commission to proceed with the compilation of a new register in accordance with the provisions of ci  the road has now been cleared for the electoral commission to proceed i am calling on every member and sympathiser of the new patriotic party and indeed on all eligible ghanaians no matter what party they belong to if any to go out and register so that they can exercise their civic responsibilities on  december  to elect a government of their choice in a free fair peaceful and transparent election the pandemic notwithstanding we have to strengthen ghanaian democracy  the december  presidential race represents probably the clearest of choices ever for the ghanaian people to make and why do i say so it is because  is between the current president and the president who was voted out in the last contest it is about leadership it is about integrity it is about the performances of the two men when given the opportunity by the ghanaian people to lead it is about measuring records against promises it is about which of the two leaders has shown in office that he knows how to manage the economy it is about which of the two leaders you the voter can trust to deliver it is about which of the two men you can trust with the future of your children it is about which of the two leaders you know you can depend on in times of crisis it is about which of the two leaders you believe can put in motion the necessary measures to revive and strengthen the economy businesses and social services and build our country out of the coronavirus pandemic i am of the firm conviction that this nation the black star of africa is on the brink of a decisive step into a brighter future which will deliver progress and prosperity to all the peoples of our country a united npp working under my leadership in tandem with my brilliant resourceful fourtime running mate vice president alhaji mahamudu bawumia who has just been resoundingly acclaimed by the national council the man who consistently sends alarm and shivers down the spine of our opponents can in all humility lead ghana and the ghanaian people to take this giant step forward let us work hard together for a great victory on  december  and embrace the future and our destiny  four more years for nana and the npp to do more for you kukurudu eshie eshie the battle is the lords good luck to us all and may god bless the new patriotic party

      "address by the president of the republicnana addo dankwa akufoaddoat the launch of the  manifesto of the new patriotic party on saturday  august  in cape coast central region it is a joy to be in this celebrated ancient city of cape coast the capital of the central region and appropriately named for generations as the athens of africa to undertake our activity of today – launching of the npp  manifesto we are doing so in a region that gave us a massive endorsement in  for which we continue to be grateful and whose mandate we have done everything to fulfil we are honoured by the attendance of no less a personage than the traditional landlord osabarima kwesi atta ii oguaamanhene who has chosen to grace the occasion with his presence osabarima thank you for being here yɛda wo ase four years ago on  october  the new patriotic party npp presented to the ghanaian people a manifesto that spelt out a programme of what we would do in office when entrusted with power at the elections we called it change an agenda for jobs creating prosperity securing the peace we had spent a lot of time and consulted widely and were guided by the core values of our party in prioritising the solutions to the many problems that faced our country i said at the launch that a manifesto represented for me a solemn social contract between the electorate and the elected i had entered into the contract by signing the document on my behalf and that of the npp by voting for us on  december  the ghanaian people had also signed their part of the contract giving us the mandate to implement the ideas in the manifesto i said i fully understood the consequence of putting my signature to a contract i know that some people do not accord much worth to a manifesto but i do and we of the npp have always taken our manifestoes seriously because we believe politics is serious business and asking for the mandate of the people to govern is serious business we believe that citizens must be treated with respect once given the mandate to govern we are bound by the promises that we make to the good people of ghana and we set about translating the promises into concrete programmes i said when we were asking for the mandate to govern that i want a ghana where government is accountable to the electorate not with artist impressions of projects and green books but with cold facts and figures fellow ghanaians you would have noticed therefore that all the presentations that have been made today have gone into great detail in providing a clear accounting for what we have done in the three years and eight months we have been in office i want to thank all the men and women who made these solid presentations i take pride especially in two things that have characterised the implementation of our programmes we have succeeded at equitable distribution which means all parts of the country have been touched by our policies and we have delivered value for money i take pride in the fact that free shs and free tvet have been delivered and our young people and their parents and guardians know that they will no longer be forced to stop school at jhs level because of financial difficulties it was not easily done and so we intend to protect it and prevent any socalled review another word for cancellation  we have no reason to believe the ndc presidential candidates newly proclaimed conversion to free shs and free tvet for eight years he and his party were loud in their assertions that they did not believe in free shs and free tvet they did not like the idea they rubbished it at every opportunity and they proclaimed that it would destroy ghanas educational system when they were in office they had a hard time trying to run even their watereddown version of their socalled progressively free education then the former president said he would review it and now we hear him say it has come to stay excellency please try another one your credibility on this one is zero free shs free tvet cannot be trusted in your hands in much the same way we would not risk putting agriculture under the ndc and its leader they will once again leave the farmers on their own without the support that is helping to make farming the profitable and fulfilling business it should be and why would anyone imagine that an ndc administration under the former president would treat businesses any differently from what they did the last time around fellow ghanaians in spite of the unexpected and dramatic entry into our lives by  and the subsequent worldwide devastation we can demonstrate that we have set the economy on a strong foundation and businesses will flourish the virus has slowed us down but it has not diverted us from the path of growth we have put the country on it is interesting to note that the ndc in opposition is not able to take the lead in doing some of the things that are most often done first by parties in opposition you might remember how long it took the ndc presidential candidate to find a running mate and they have not yet got a manifesto i wonder what will happen the day they have a government to run as well or maybe it is simply showing the country they do not attach much importance to a manifesto nor should we expect that whatever is written in it would reflect their beliefs which presupposes of course that they now have or hold on to any firm beliefs instead of bending in the direction of whatever they think is currently fashionable we wish them luck with their manifesto whenever they are done with it we in the npp know from whence we came we have never had any identity crisis and our manifesto always gives us the opportunity to reiterate our historic stand as the party of the rule of law the party of good governance the party of business the party that builds and creates wealth the party of social justice and the party that cares for every ghanaian in other words it helps to believe in something to spend time and energy to think it through and to get passionate and competent people to lead in the implementation of the programme on the day of my acclamation as the presidential candidate of our party for which i continue to express my deep gratitude to almighty god and to the myriad of officials and the faithful supporters of our great party i said that there was a clear choice before our nation as the two main candidates could be adjudged on similar basis the people of ghana could decide who among the two had made a better job of governing our country as president i know that the ndc presidential candidate his excellency john dramani mahama believes and says often that ghanaians have a short memory and he must hold strongly to this belief otherwise i doubt he would have summoned the courage to be seeking another term after the disaster that was his presidency ghanaians might have short memories but not short enough for us to have forgotten the brokendown freezers irons and other household equipment thanks to the five years of dumsor our memories are not short enough to forget that the economy under him was such a wreck that there was a ban placed on all recruitment into our public services our memories are not short enough to forget that teachers taught for three years and were only paid for three months our memories are certainly not short enough to forget that he brought our entire financial services system to near collapse i have heard him make the extraordinary claim that ghanas economy was in tatters not because of the  pandemic but because of mismanagement i doubt that he can recognise a wellmanaged economy even if it slapped him in the face luckily for us we do not have to rely on his judgement or assessment of the economy but it is important to tell him just in case there are others like him around that ghana is today in a position to be able to provide one hot meal for jhs  students who are back in school in the midst of a pandemic to pay for six  months the water bills of all ghanaians to subsidise the electricity bills of all ghanaians for three  months indeed we thank the almighty that the pandemic did not strike under his presidency when there was no money in the national kitty to pay teachers and nurses allowances     we are very much aware of the realities of the times we know the havoc that  has wreaked on our economies and livelihoods i have asked our party members to keep these sensibilities in their minds in all they do as they go about campaigning for votes adherence to the covid protocols means we cannot resort to the traditional methods of campaigning and i urge all of us to obey strictly these rules we cannot have the traditional crowds and rallies and wherever there are gatherings we have to try to observe the social distancing rules it has been said by the ndc presidential candidate that npp policies lack sense if running an emerging oil economy into the arms of the imf because of indiscipline in the management of the public finances is sense i am happy that the npp has another concept of sense if having sense means cancelling teacher trainee and nurses allowances is sense i am happy that the npp has another concept of sense if having sense means recording the worst economic management statistics of modern times with the lowest rate of growth of the last thirty  years i am happy the npp has another concept of sense having sense in the npp means being able to take an economy growing at  to an economy that grew on the average for three  successive years at  per year before the pandemic and was rightly acknowledged as one of the best performing economies not just in africa but also in the world having sense in the npp means executing the programme for planting for food and jobs which has led to the revival of ghanaian agriculture from the doldrums of the ndc years bringing in its wake bumper harvests and affordable food prices in our markets and exports of significant quantities of food stuffs to our neighbours having sense in the npp means implementing policies which according to the latest ghana living standards survey has resulted in a decline in unemployment rates from  in  to  in  i am happy with and prefer the npps sense let me use this occasion to assure the ghanaian people that as president of the republic i will do everything within my means to ensure the peace and stability of our country in the runup to during and after the polls of  december  the struggle of our forebears in the danquahdombobusia political tradition to construct at great sacrifice a democratic open free system of government in ghana will not be jeopardised by me and i am calling on all actors in the political space to join me to ensure the maintenance of the peace and stability of our country and to conduct ourselves in a manner devoid of violence and ethnocentrism the ghana project can best be achieved in unity tolerance and mutual respect fellow ghanaians the npp has in  one target and one objective only that is to secure with your support and the blessing of the almighty in free fair peaceful and transparent elections another decisive victory on  december  – a victory that will give us a clear majority in parliament and a first round presidential victory and enable us to do four more years of advancing the peace progress and prosperity of our nation for you we have an excellent message as set out in our manifesto leadership of service protecting our progress transforming ghana for all and as eloquently articulated by that brilliant ghanaian mahamudu bawumia my most esteemed running mate and vice president which will protect our progress and continue down the path of social and economic transformation on which all ghanaians are now embarked  fellow ghanaians the battle remains the lords it is four more years for nana and the npp to do more for you may god bless the new patriotic party and us all and may god bless our homeland ghana and

      "the president of the republic nana addo dankwa akufoaddo says his government has undertaken arguably the boldest initiatives since independence to reform and strengthen the capacity of the nations institutions to tackle corruption in the public sector according to president akufoaddo government has fought corruption not in words but in concrete deeds we have shunned mere exhortations and showy denunciations of unproved corruption it has been a holistic approach delivering the keynote address at the national anticorruption conference organized by the commission for human rights and administrative justice chraj on friday thdecember  the president stated emphatically that we have protected the public purse we have made institutional reforms we have enacted additional requisite laws and we have resourced more adequately the accountability organs of state our fight against corruption has been grounded on legislative financial and institutional action and not on lipservice outlining the initiatives put forth by his government since coming into office in  he stated that he has first had to make sure that every single alleged act of corruption levelled against any of his appointees have been investigated by independent bodies such as chraj the cid and in some cases by parliament itself citing the example of the suspension of the then head of the public procurement agency the president indicated that following recommendations from chraj based on their investigation i removed him from office in october  and the office of special prosecutor is seized with the matter of prosecution if an appointee is cleared of any wrongdoing the evidence adduced and recommendations made by these agencies after the investigations are concluded are what clear the accused persons not myself continuing president akufoaddo indicated that there are some who refuse to accept my method of proceeding and havecharacterisedme as a clearing agent because for them the mere allegation without more is enough to merit condemnation of the public official even though they did not apply this principle when they were in office for my part i will not set aside due process in the fight against corruption no matter how much opprobrium this incurs for me with a clear understanding that corruption thrives in an atmosphere conducive to its concealment he told the gathering that his government has ensured the passage of the right to information act  act  which will foster a culture of transparency and accountability in public affairs in addition to this president akufoaddo revealed that parliament has passed the witness protection act  act  to which he gave his assent on august the same year the act he explained established a witness protection agency to establish a witness protection scheme as a vehicle for offering protection to persons who are required to cooperate with law enforcement agencies as witnesses in the investigation and prosecution of cases particularly corruption cases affecting public officers last year he stated that the criminal offences amendment act   was passed to amend section  of the criminal offences act tocategorisethe offence of corruption previously a misdemeanor as a felony and to guarantee stiffer punishments of terms of imprisonment of not less than twelve  years and not more than twentyfive  years in prison the president indicated that other laws passed by his administration and which have enhanced significantly the capacity of the state in the fight against corruption are the revenue administration amendment act  act  fiscal responsibility act  act  state interests and governance authority act  act  antimoney laundering act  act  corporate restructuring and insolvency act  act  companies act  narcotics control commission act  act  and real estate agency act  act  underlying thedigitalisationagenda of his government which comprises a robust national identification system digital property address system paperless port system ejustice system pensions and insurance data adigitisedland registry and mobile money interoperability system he stressed is the overarching objective to improve transparency accountability and efficiency in the public sector adigitisedenvironment ultimately helps to eliminate and prevent corruption in various institutions and agencies the passport office ports andharbours registrargenerals department national health insurance service driver vehicle and licensing authority which hitherto were fertile grounds for corrupt activity are being transformed beyond recognition he said he continued the introduction of theghanagovplatform has significantly reduced the risk of public sector corruption through embezzlement making it possible for services to be accessed and payments made online by card or mobile money with a considerable reduction in the conduit of middlemen or goroboys budgetary allocation touching on the allocation of resources to the accountability institutions of state president akufoaddo stressed that it is also an undeniable fact that budgetary allocations for institutions actively engaged in public sector accountability ie the office of the auditorgeneral the judiciary parliament and the ghana police service have witnessed unprecedented increases since i assumed office in  at the end of  he indicated that the budgetary allocation to parliament had witnessed a one hundred and ninety four percent  increase compared to what was inherited in  the police had seen its budget increase by one hundred and sixtytwo percent  at the end of  in comparison to  the audit service had recorded an eighty three percent  rise in its budgetary allocation at the end of  as compared to  the budget of the judiciary had risen by fiftyone percent  at the end of  compared to  the budget of the office of the attorneygeneral had increased by fifty percent  at the end of  compared to  whilst the budget of chraj had increased by twentyone percent  at the end of  compared to  these figures according to president akufoaddo reflect my resolve to ensure that institutions of state of relevance in the anticorruption agendum are properly equipped to discharge satisfactorily the mandate of their offices on ensuring value for money through the review of single source and restricted tender applications he stated that the public procurement authority between january  and august  recorded savings to the tune of gh¢ billion in  my first year in office the savings made over the year as a result of such reviews amounted to some eight hundred million cedis gh¢ million contrast this to the situation in  where a grand total of zero savings was made he added in the area of investigations and prosecution of corruption and corruption related offences the president noted that a distinct innovation was undertaken by his administration in  with the decision to set up an office of special prosecutor through the passage of the office of special prosecutor act  act  the establishment of the office of special prosecutor represents the most courageous measure by any government since independence to prosecute corruption in the executive arm of government the monopoly of prosecutorial authority by an attorneygeneral hired or fired by a president had been identified by many as a key factor standing in the way of law enforcement and prosecution as a credible tool in the fight against corruption before  he added    ghana is a west african country bound on the north by burkina faso on the east by togo on the south

low investor confidence and significant structural bottlenecks the basic facts of our unhappy inheritance are welldocumented –  rate of inflation a  fiscal deficit  rate of interest a  rate of gdp growth the lowest in two decades – all under an imfsponsored bailout programme we set to work quickly and i am glad to say that we have been able to stabilize the economy exit satisfactorily the imf programme and restore confidence in the economy at the end of  the economy was characterised by strong growth in response to implementation of government flagship programmes single digit inflation reduced fiscal deficits with three consecutive years of primary surpluses relatively stable exchange rate significant improvement in the current account with three consecutive years of trade surpluses strong foreign exchange reserve buffers and markedly reduced lending rates the global pandemic of  threatened to derail the progress chalked over the first three  years of my administration its impact has led to the revision in gdp growth for  from  to  and later to  to reflect significant slowdown in economic activities as a consequence of the effects of  on lives and livelihoods the proactive decisions taken by government to fight the pandemic as well as revitalise and transform the economy with the one hundredbillioncedi ghana cares obaatampa programme anchors bright prospects for the mediumterm government will continue to implement prudent fiscal measures to quicken the pace of fiscal consolidation and in march this year the minister for finance will come to this august house to provide further details on the measures to be taken to restore our country back to the path of economic recovery mr speaker government in four years has recorded a number of significant milestones in our quest to formalise and modernise the ghanaian economy we believe it is the fairest and fastest way to achieve our goals the national identity card rollout the national digital property addressing system the interoperability of mobile money transactions the introduction of the paperless operations at the port ebusiness registration system and access to digital financial services are all part of the drive to formalise our economy and enhance its productivity for years there had been unhappiness and sometimes agitation on the subject of the geographic delineation of regions in the country in the particular case of what was to become the oti region their demand for a new region stretched back to more than sixty  years we decided that we needed to resolve these matters to be able to bring governance nearer to the people the constitutional process for the creation of new regions was put in place and after the petitions and stakeholder consultations the people in the identified areas had the opportunity to vote in historic referenda there were overwhelming approvals for the yes vote in the referenda held in fortyseven  districts across four existing regions this led to the creation of six  new regions and we now have sixteen  instead of the ten  regions that existed at the start of my administration four years ago it sounded recklessly optimistic but free shs and free tvet are now entrenched parts of our educational setup in a few years time we can guarantee that the basic education for the workforce in our country would be at the secondary level it is a transformational step we have taken which should quicken the pace of development all round and give us confidence in our future in  it appeared to some like the same old refrain when we said farmers and agriculture would get the highest priority but we can see the difference it makes when a government treats farmers with respect and spends resources and expertise on agriculture we have seen the dramatic turnaround of our agricultural fortunes due to the progressive policies that have improved the living standards of farmers in the country the excellently executed policy for planting for food and jobs has laid the foundation for the agricultural transformation of our country we are able to say that our country is now a net exporter of food and we no longer have to import basic foods like plantain and tomatoes mr speaker ghana rice is the preferred choice in an increasing number of our homes as the growing processing and packaging of rice become a more established and attractive industry during this covid crisis we have mercifully been spared the spectre of food shortages on the contrary thanks to planting for food and jobs food has been in abundance in our markets across the country throughout the ages food processing has provided the takeoff point for the industrialisation of many nations and we are taking that lesson to heart as we pursue the goal to industrialise modernise and create jobs for the young people of our nation the onedistrictonefactory programme is part of the anchor on which we are building the comprehensive industrialization of our country much of the work has now been done to put in place the framework for the rapid implementation of projects the factories that are currently in place and in production reflect the underlying principle of the programme which is the equitable distribution of development projects around the country the prospects of our becoming the automobile hub in west africa are growing stronger every day with the investments being made in the country by global manufacturing giants in the automobile industry probably the most difficult problem the government met on coming into office was the state of the banking and financial sector many of our banks were in distress and had been kept on unsustainable and artificial life support by the central bank the supervisory agencies were unfortunately not performing their duties and the governance and management structures of many the banks were clearly not adequate if truth be told many of the finance houses were running what can only be called glorified ponzi schemes and had lured many depositors into these schemes we were in a desperate situation and urgent radical measures had to be taken to prevent the collapse of the entire financial and banking sector the bank of ghana under new leadership intervened and has restored sanity to the sector and in the process we have saved the banks involved and  million depositors funds the government has had to find some twentyone billion cedis gh¢ billion to fund the cleaning up exercise this exercise has enabled a more robust financial and banking services sector to emerge the better to finance the rapid development of our nation mr speaker there are painful lessons that we all have to imbibe from this debacle there is no question but that many people got attracted to the unsustainable high interest rates that some of these financial houses were offering in all financial dealings we have to accept what the experts tell us that whenever whatever on offer sounds too good to be true it invariably ends up being untrue and unsustainable government is committed to paying all validated claims and i expect the process to be completed soon after the courts grant the liquidation orders for the remaining failed fund management companies mr speaker government since my assumption of office has increased annually the budgetary allocations to all the accountability institutions of state including parliament and the judiciary with the latter for example being the beneficiary of ninety  newly constructed courts across the country our security agencies have been equipped with more personnel and the requisite tools needed to maintain law and order as well as protect the territorial integrity of our borders at the  cabinet meeting the decision was taken to exclude the security services ie the police service immigration service fire service prisons service as well as other security and intelligence agencies just like the armed forces from the unification of pension schemes in other words all the security agencies will continue to enjoy benefits under the cap  pension scheme and the appropriate legal regime will be put in place by the ministry of employment and labour relations to ensure this mr speaker i am pleased to report that our undertaking to bring peace to dagbon has been successful for decades this ancient and proud kingdom had been bedeviled with conflict since  when a fresh eruption of the conflict ended in the tragic killing of my friend the ya na yakubu andani dagbon had become designated as a troubled land a generation of young people had grown up knowing nothing else but dagbon as a troubled land where there was no peace and public officials hesitated to accept postings there on assumption of office we decided to tackle the problem with renewed vigour luckily for all of us the three eminent chiefs who had been at the helm of the peace process since  did not relent on their commitment or enthusiasm for the cause of peace our efforts bore fruit a historic settlement was reached and peace has been restored to dagbon i recall the joy and deep satisfaction that i felt on the day that i attended in yendi the enskinment of the new dignified ya na mahama abukari ii and i carry my honourary title of dagbon malti naa abudani which he graciously bestowed on me with pride i admit freely that it was one of the highlights of the past four years for me as president of the republic i was happy not just because a long running problem had finally been resolved but also because i know that the development and modernisation of our country that we all desire can only happen when there is peace and unity in ghana i express the deepest gratitude of the nation to the many people who worked so hard to give dagbon the opportunity for its people to lead normal lives again i pay homage especially to the three eminent chiefs who led the process the redoubtable asantehene otumfuo osei tutu ii the overlord of mamprugu the nayiri naa bohugu abdulai mahami sheriga and the overlord of the gonja state the yagbonwura tuntumba boresa sulemana jakpa and i congratulate the dagbon people themselves for deciding to embrace peace we pray that we learn all the hard lessons and reject the use of violence to resolve the problems that will come up in our lives mr speaker since i am on the subject of highlights this might be the appropriate place to recall the year of return  marked the  anniversary of the start of the transatlantic slave trade and we declared the year of return as a mark of solidarity with the descendants of the millions of africans that were taken from our shores into the americas and caribbean black people in the african diaspora those in the americas and caribbean and indeed in the rest of the world took to their hearts our invitation and came in their numbers to ghana our country throbbed to the sound of the returnees and the joy of finding a welcome after the trauma of four hundred  years of the horror of the slave trade the young people of the world came to ghana and it was a good experience for us all to play host to the world we entered the year  full of hope and the determination to build on the successes and joy of  which ended on such a high note then the unexpected struck and our world was literally changed overnight with the arrival of the  pandemic this pandemic has shaken economies and public health systems the world over and brought even some of the wealthiest and most developed countries to their knees over here in ghana our first priority in fighting the pandemic has been and will continue to be the health and safety of our citizens we pioneered lifesaving innovations that the who has since sought to replicate elsewhere our success thus far is a testament to the tireless work of our researchers scientists advisors public health managers frontline healthcare workers hospital staff contact tracers and so many others who have dedicated themselves to the fight to keep ghanaians safe our nation is deeply indebted to them prior to the onset of the pandemic on our shores government had succeeded in restoring the highlyindebted national health insurance scheme we inherited in january  back to rude health some ninetyfive thousand health workers were recruited into the public health sector and we ensured that each constituency now has a wellequipped functioning ambulance  has presented us with the opportunity to resolve some longstanding problems in the health sector we have taken steps to resolve the problem of infrastructure deficit in the healthcare system once and for all with the inception of agenda  and the start of the building of hospitals around the country we are upgrading district hospitals where they exist and establishing new ones where they do not we are also investing in our next generation of ghanaian doctors and nurses throughout the period i have tried to keep the ghanaian people informed with regular broadcasts so we all know what is going on this has led to the phrase fellow ghanaians attaining a new status as ghanaians brought their famed ingenuity to find relief in the doom of the devastation being wreaked by the pandemic our artists and designers have brought their expertise to bring unexpected relief we are wearing the fellow ghanaians and this too shall pass fabric with pride and the knowledge that we are able to find something positive out of the darkest events i have had a team of dedicated ghanaian professionals formed into a taskforce who have been advising me throughout the crisis and i am extremely appreciative of them and all those who have risen to the occasion and helped us cope with the crisis i am using this opportunity to again remind all of us that the pandemic is still with us and we have to maintain the protocols to keep us safe mr speaker these past four years it has been a joy and a great privilege to serve our nation as president there were many moments of great satisfaction some moments of frustration and some moments of disappointment that is not saying anything special that is life and i did not expect that everything that government tries to do would have universal acceptance there is one subject about which i believe we the people need to have an open conversation and that is galamsey should we allow or should we not allow galamsey the illegal mining that leads to the pollution of our water bodies and the devastation of our landscape as i have said often the almighty having blessed us with considerable deposits of precious minerals there would always be mining in ghana indeed there has always been mining in ghana the problem we have is the use of modern technology that leads to the illegal mining methods posing serious dangers to our water bodies and the health of our environment the pollution of our rivers and water resources has been so acute on occasion that the ghana water company is unable to afford the distilling of water to make for safe drinking we have to talk about galamsey we who are leaders owe it to the country to take the subject out of the partypolitical arena and have an honest conversation about this menace to our future mr speaker by dint of hard work we have ensured that presently our countrys reputation amongst the comity of nations is high for the first time in our history ghana has been honoured by her peers with the privilege of playing host to a panafrican institution – the secretariat of the african continental free trade area afcfta one of the most momentous developments in the modern history of our continent i have also been honoured to follow in the footsteps of my predecessor presidents – specifically their excellencies jerry john rawlings john agyekum kufuor and john dramani mahama – with my appointment as chairperson of the authority of heads of state and government of the economic community of west african states ecowas i am aware of the enormity of the task ahead and i assure the community that i will discharge my duties to the best of my abilities mr speaker i would like to say a special thank you to the members of this august house to the members of this seventh parliament in our fourth republic i speak as someone who has served three terms in this house and i can safely say that this seventh parliament has been the busiest ever and arguably the most productive in the history of our country you have passed almost fifty  pieces of legislative instruments the acts have been wide ranging in scope and reach we finally have the right to information act we have a special prosecutor act the ghana integrated aluminum development corporation act the ghana integrated iron and steel development act the witness protection act the lands act the historic private members bill and lots more in many ways you have helped transform ghana and you have every right collectively to be proud of the work you have done mr speaker the next parliament is not going to be anything like this one that ends today i do not suggest that the house might not be as busy but the sitting arrangements the source and decibel levels of sound from the house would certainly be different the good people of ghana have spoken and given parliament an almost equal strength on both sides of the house we have no choice but to work with the consequences of the desires of the people the house would have to be more accommodating of each others views and probably devise new ways of conducting its affairs in the interest of the good governance of our people i am thankful to the ghanaian people and to the almighty that i have been given a clear mandate to govern the country for four more years and thereby given the opportunity to complete tasks consolidate some of the farreaching measures we have introduced and initiate further changes and adjustments to policies and practices the constitution demands that we go to the people after four years to ask for a mandate and we must listen to the voice of the people i said during the election campaign and it is my firm and passionate view that i should only be president in a fairly conducted election which i believe in all sincerity the election of  december was i recognise that my main opponent in the election former president john mahama has gone to the supreme court to seek its intervention and grant reliefs that he believes were compromised in the conduct of the elections it is good for the nation that in the end he chose the legal path instead of the pockets of violence that have attended the rejection of the results by his party in the period after the elections we all have to make a deliberate decision to invest in the rule of law and uphold the integrity of the institutions of state so that no person or group of persons take the law into their own hands with impunity mr speaker it has been my great pleasure and exceptional privilege these past four years to have served as president of our beloved country i am grateful to this honourable house for its cooperation in the enterprise to attain our common goal and aspiration of advancing the peace progress and welfare of the ghanaian people i will see some of you in february and those of you who will not be present have my best wishes for the future may god bless the parliament of the  republic and us all and may god bless our homeland ghana and make her

      "inaugural address by the president of the republicnana addo dankwa akufoaddoat his swearing in as president of the republic and commanderinchief of the ghana armed forces on thursday  january  mr speaker  i extend a hearty akwaaba our word of welcome to their excellencies the distinguished leaders of sister states from our region and continent as well as to eminent representatives from other friendly nations and international organisations who are gathered here in the vibrant city of accra capital of ghana to join us on this auspicious occasion i thank each and every one of you for being present at this inauguration of my second mandate  notwithstanding your attendance is an expression of solidarity and friendship that speaks volumes of your attachment to the goals and aspirations of the ghanaian people and state for which we are very grateful i must at the outset express my warm congratulations to my good friend and colleague of many years in this house the rt hon alban sumana kingsford bagbin on his assumption of office as the speaker of the eighth parliament of the  republic nearly three decades of devoted service to parliament by you has culminated in this moment which has seen your elevation to the third great office of state of our nation together you and i will be chartering new territory in the governance and politics of the  republic for this is the first time in the life of this republic that a president from one party will be obliged by the exigencies of the moment and the will of the people to work in all sincerity and cooperation with a speaker of parliament from another party i am confident that both of us will be guided in our relationship by the supreme interest of our people in ensuring good governance in the ordering of the affairs of state i want to assure you of my wholehearted determination to work with you to advance the peace progress and prosperity of the ghanaian people once again many congratulations to you and the reelected and new members of parliament a few moments ago i took for the second time the oath of office to serve as president of the republic of ghana i follow in the exalted footsteps of two of my predecessors the  and  presidents of the  republic their excellencies jerry john rawlings and john agyekum kufuor who served two successive terms in office i cannot therefore take this honour and privilege bestowed on my modest self lightly and i thank almighty god and the ghanaian people who by an emphatic margin renewed my mandate in office for four more years in the elections of  december it is a demonstration of the confidence and trust you the ghanaian people have reposed in me not only in appreciation for the achievements chalked throughout my first four  years but more significantly for the considerable amount of work that is to be done over the next four  years in our drive to take our nation firmly onto the path of progress prosperity and development following the havoc wreaked by  this is a task i wholeheartedly accept and i assure all ghanaians that i will do my utmost to deliver on this mandate the accomplishment of this mandate is going to take place within the context of ghanas maturing democracy the ghanaian people have manifested time and again in these twentyeight  years of the  republic their determination to build a free democratic peaceful nation which is respectful of individual liberties and human rights the rule of law and the principles of democratic accountability a governance structure built on the separation of powers provides the best vehicle for the protection of these values with a wellresourced judiciary and parliament as the principal accountability organs of the state this has been the main thrust of public policy in these past four years and will continue to be so in the next the unity and stability of our country are the welcome outcomes of such a development this is how we can ensure in the words of one of the great figures of ghanaian nationalism the illustrious joseph boakye danquah that we have a system of government under which those who are in control of government are under the control of those who are governed the sheer candospirit of the ghanaian which i have witnessed all my life is the bedrock on which we can build the ghana of our dreams indeed four years ago at my first inauguration i urged all ghanaians to be and i quote citizens and not spectators i appealed to you to be active participants in the effort to help build the ghana we want – the democratic free prosperous and united ghana envisioned by our founding fathers as the black star of africa in my first term as president i was able to count on the contribution of all citizens in attempting to create this ghana what i have seen these last four years is further evidence if any were needed that the ghanaian will no longer accept poverty and deprivation as his or her portion but is rather determined to work to chart a path of growth and development for himself or herself today our economy even in the face of the global pandemic of  continues to show resilience and a much faster rate of recovery than originally envisaged and was indeed one of the fastest growing economies in the world in  ghana remains one of the most attractive destinations on the continent for foreign direct investment with the presence in the country of some of the worlds largest conglomerates attesting to this fact establishing a strong economy undergoing structural transformation to valueadded activities which will generate jobs for our young people and enhance their living standards will be the main preoccupation of my second term together we are ensuring that the basic tenets of social justice are met many said it was beyond us but we have ensured that financial considerations no longer determine the fate of the ghanaian child because of the implementation of the free senior high school policy once willing and able senior high school education is the minimum education to be received by every ghanaian child access to quality healthcare is no more a luxury ordinary people cannot afford following the revival of the national health insurance scheme our aim is to reach universal health coverage as soon as possible  food production has increased significantly and a conscious effort has been made to improve the living standards of our farmers the newly constructed warehouses dotted across the country are storing the surpluses for export to our neighbours and the programme for planting for food and jobs has become the veritable rock on which the successful future of our agriculture is being built our roads are being constructed at a much faster pace than before and yes i acknowledge there are still many more kilometres to construct we defined last year as the year of roads this year will be the second year of roads as we continue with our focus on dealing with the deficit in our road infrastructure the development of our rail sector on which considerable resources and energies are being devoted will open up the country and lead to the creation of a more connected society and will also help realise the goal of regional and continental integration  the arrival of  drove home the lesson to all of us that we have to be selfreliant the pandemic has emphasised the fact that we cannot continue to be living on edge in a daytoday economy this is dangerous for our survival and it is important that we set up buffers of protection in all aspects of our lives so when there was a shortage in the supply of personal protective equipment at a time when they were being sold at extortionist prices on the world market the enterprise of the ghanaian shone through we produced right here in ghana our own sanitisers face masks medical scrubs gowns liquid soap amongst others we can indeed build a ghana beyond aid if we make full use as we must of the enterprise and ingenuity of our people especially our young people the prominent role being played by young people in the digitisation journey of our nation is strong proof of the feasibility of this objective and ghana is set to become one of the most digitised economies in africa in the next few years in this same vein i expect the locally produced eku juice one of the results of governments onedistrictonefactory flagship policy to replace rapidly the imported fruit juices on the shelves of our supermarkets not because anyone will so decree but because the quality of the locally produced one is as good if not superior i doubt that anyone would ordinarily mention akpeteshie the local gin as a possible item on the world market i cannot vouch for its taste or potency since i gave up alcohol many years ago but i can say that the made in ghana and beautifully packaged apio i have recently seen can compete in the most sophisticated markets in the world my boundless confidence in the energy of the ghanaian makes me believe that we can become the prosperous nation we aspire to and soon we have good reason to be proud of what we have been able to achieve so far mr speaker we know that the democracy we seek to build and entrench in ghana will ultimately succeed if we build a prosperous nation and our people are at peace with themselves and with the world i pledge before this august house and the good people of ghana that all i do will be for the common good and with the firm foundation laid in my first term of office we shall take a significant step towards reducing the infrastructure deficit that has plagued us all throughout our nationhood the remaining fifteen percent  of our communities without electricity would be covered by the end of my second term we have already begun constructing hospitals in the remaining districts that do not have one – a process which will be completed within a year the percentage of ghanaians without access to potable water is set to reduce significantly following the commencement of work on a number of water supply projects across all parts of the country the majority of our people live in unacceptable housing and we shall tackle the problem with vigour with discipline and caution just as we have done since march  we in ghana can continue to reduce the number of active cases of  which currently stands at a little over nine hundred  and open up our country again to the rest of the region continent and the entire world we have taken the bold step of reopening all our schools again because of our fundamental conviction that education is the key to our future we will do everything possible to ensure not only the safety of the children but of teachers and nonteaching staff as well we ghanaians have always been very much aware of our place in our neighbourhood in our continent and in the world we recognise that poverty and insecurity plague our region and thus we shall continue to work to make our voice carry the weight of our convictions and contribute to making our world a safer and happier place we shall play our full part in the deliberations and activities of all the organisations to which we belong – ecowas the african union commonwealth la francophonie the united nations and the others ghana which has the privilege of hosting the secretariat of the african continental free trade area intends to be one of the main drivers of its success the afcfta provides us africans with a great opportunity to exploit and develop our resources for the benefit of our own people and end the centuriesold exploitation of our continents vast wealth for the benefit of others  in the words of the historic first leader of our nation the celebrated kwame nkrumah it is clear that we must find an african solution to our problems and that this can only be found in african unity divided we are weak united africa could become one of the greatest forces for good in the world  to my fellow ghanaians i invite all of you to join in the exciting business of developing our country there are endless opportunities if we remain united what our forebears dreamed of we will achieve if we inherited dreams and visions from our founding fathers we should leave legacies of achievements and realities to our children and their children for i believe in the limitless prospects of ghana and of us her people so let us be up and doing and with faith in the almighty seize our destiny mr speaker may god bless us all and our homeland ghana and make her great and strong your excellencies once again akwaaba i thank you for your attention   ghana is a west african country bound on the

      "address by the president of the republic nana addo dankwa akufoaddo at the  independence day celebration held virtually on saturday  march  the recovery of the nation from the pandemic sixtyfour  years ago we freed our nation ghana from the shackles of colonialism and imperialism we were the first nation in colonial africa to gain our independence from the colonial power and thus became the torchbearer of the struggle for liberation of the african continent  as we lowered the british union jack on the eve of  march  and replaced it with our own the iconic red gold green flag with the black star in the centre the mood of citizens of this newlyminted state was one of unrestrained excitement and jubilation because of the prospects of what the future held for us later that night at the old polo grounds that vision of what an independent ghana could be that is a prosperous progressive country which was to be an active player in the affairs of the continent and the world was eloquently laid bare by our historic first leader kwame nkrumah  the world indeed took notice of us we had the likes of dr martin luther king mrs coretta scott king philip randolph adam clayton powell ralph bunche and horace mann leaders of the american civil rights movement as well as us vice president richard nixon present with us to commemorate the birth of our new nation we were an example for the rest of africa to follow not surprisingly much was expected of the posterboy country  on sixtythree  previous occasions we have usually congregated in our capital of accra and recently in other locations around the country tamale in  and kumasi last year to celebrate our nations independence at these annual events we have sought to express a deep consciousness of love for country and the importance of ensuring that we realise our potential as the black star of africa year after year we commit ourselves to ensuring that we work to lift the standard of living of the ghanaian and help construct an economy that is capable of creating a society of opportunities for all  it is taking quite some time for us to get there but i believe there is far more selfconfidence among us ghanaians today than there has been since the very early days of selfgovernment that we can make it if we work at it today freedom and the cultivation of democratic values are strengthening our determination to bring into being a new ghana that is neither pawn nor victim of the world order attachment to the rule of law respect for individual liberties human rights the principles of democratic accountability and the dictates of social justice has deepened for our common benefit nevertheless we recognise that the biggest challenge confronting us is to be able to put our country on the path of sustained progress and prosperity and enhance the wellbeing of every ghanaian  since  a considerable amount of work has been undertaken to help us achieve this objective consistently for three successive years our nation had one of the fastest growing economies in the world leading to us becoming the largest destination of foreign direct investment in west africa global automobile companies had either setup shop in ghana or had expressed their desire to do so the basic tenets of social justice ie access to education and healthcare were being guaranteed for all our people we had become selfsufficient in food production and for the first time in a long while exported our surpluses to our neighbours sustained efforts through digitisation were being made to formalise our economy and we had hastened our critical journey of industrialisation and valueaddition activities whose end result would be to create jobs for the teeming masses of ghanaians  successful ghanaian diplomacy enabled the african union to agree to the location here in accra of the secretariat of the african continental free trade area afcfta arguably the most important initiative of the au since its foundation this is the first time since independence that we have had the privilege of playing host to a major panafrican institution the single african market which begun trading on  january will present ghanaian enterprises and businesses with a huge opportunity for the rapid development of the ghanaian and african economy  when the global pandemic of  struck it derailed our progress and wreaked havoc on all aspects of national life lives and livelihoods have been affected the economy has suffered and government has had to cushion households and businesses from the effects of the virus if any more evidence were needed of the impact of  the fact that this the  independence day celebration has had to be cancelled and substituted with essentially a virtual celebration is one of them  collectively my fellow ghanaians we all worked to ensure a relatively favourable situation with respect to the virus when it first broke out in as much as our active case count has recently risen i appeal to all of you to help ensure its decline we did that before and we can do it again yes the first vaccines have arrived in the country and they have begun to be deployed and i appeal passionately to each one of you to take the vaccine when it is your turn but however we cannot afford to let go of the enhanced hygiene and mask wearing protocols which should define our way of living these protocols have not only helped in the fight against  but have also helped ensure that cholera for example is no longer a health concern  if we are to be successful in building a resilient ghana capable of withstanding in future external shocks such as  then we must all put our shoulders to the wheel already government has taken steps to revitalise and transform the economy a process which is hinged on the one hundredbillioncedi ghana cares obaatampa programme the lynchpin of our drive towards the rapid industrial transformation of our economy our main national priority the minister for finance will this month god willing provide to parliament further details on the measures to be taken to spur on the process of economic recovery  a year from now the benefits of economic recovery will begin to show a year from now our quest to move ghana to a situation beyond aid will be accelerated and our selfreliance enhanced a year from today we should regain our pride of place as one of the fastest growing economies not only in africa but also in the world a year from now we should be processing more and more of our raw materials to help create jobs for the millions of ghanaian youths a year from now more and more of ghanaian children should be having access to education a year from now every district and region should have a hospital where residents will be able to have decent affordable healthcare  fellow ghanaians this is not beyond us if we put our hearts and minds to it we who were the first to gain our independence in colonial africa can make it and protect our heritage and environment let us not allow our energies to be sapped by either the failures of the past or the challenges of today let us embrace todays challenges as opportunities for a brighter tomorrow let us redefine our sense of national responsibility and remove any doubt some may continue to have about our ability to manage our own affairs let us devote ourselves to the freedom and welfare of mother ghana  albeit an arduous task i am confident that with dedication hard work honesty and integrity we can fulfill the dreams and aspirations of the founding fathers of our nation who envisioned us to be a dynamic progressive prosperous and united nation a nation that under god in jb danquahs immortal words cherished its ancient freedom we must all step up and play significant roles in the development of ghana our motherland let us bequeath to our children their children and generations unborn a nation of hope and opportunity not one of despair and retrogression with god on our side we can unleash our considerable energies and make our own unique contribution to the growth of world civilisation  happy  independence day celebration to all of us and may god bless us all

hon alban kingsford sumana bagbin on becoming speaker of the  parliament his has been a distinguished career having entered the  parliament of the  republic in  and i came to meet him in the  parliament in  he has been majority leader minister of state one of the three wisemen in a previous government  deputy speaker of parliament and now finds himself in this elevated position of being the third most important person in the governance structure of our country it is wholly appropriate that at such a critical period in the history of our country my senior in parliament and i should work together for the wellbeing of the ghanaian people mr speaker i wish you well in the discharge of the duties of this high office mr speaker in  i was here for the first time as president of the republic having won the election of  and having inherited a faltering economy and an expectant people between that time and  i sought to deliver on the mandate reposed on me and my party the new patriotic party and gain once again the confidence of the ghanaian people it was by no means a straightforward task we were able to deliver on most of our  promises in spite of the considerable challenges we confronted and the setbacks we encountered we were confident our record in office would put us in good stead before the electorate and earn us a second term in office which it did it means that the reason for which the ghanaian people went to the polls on  december ie to seek an improvement in their living standards and the rapid transformation of the economy must continue in earnest it means that the clarion call of four more for nana and the npp to do more for you must be realised and i intend to do so the commencement of this process has been facilitated by members of this house and i am thankful to you for enabling government to be duly constituted the expeditious and thorough manner in which my ministers were scrutinised by the appointments committee and the approval by the full house of each of the twentynine  substantive ministers for me was an indication of the collective determination of both sides of the house with mutual regard for each other to work together for the good of the country this is what the ghanaian people demand from us by insisting on virtual parity in the house between the two major parties of our country the realisation of the ghana project and not the attainment of narrow partisan interests must be the guiding principle of the business to be conducted in the house as president of the republic i give my firm commitment to this end and i assure mr speaker and the legislature of the cooperation of the executive in this endeavour as i indicated in my acceptance speech on the night of  december  now is the time for each and every one of us irrespective of our political affiliations to unite join hands stand shouldertoshoulder and work hard to place ghana where she deserves to be  mr speaker in the face of a global pandemic that has ravaged lives and livelihoods in all parts of the world we cannot afford to pursue interests that will leave our nation and its citizens the poorer for it  has impacted heavily on economic activities created uncertainty weakened global growth conditions whilst putting undue strain on already weak and fragile health systems particularly in developing countries mr speaker between  and the first quarter of  we had made considerable gains in the management of the national economy where we witnessed annual average gdp growth of seven percent  single digit inflation reduced fiscal deficits with three consecutive years of primary surpluses a relatively stable exchange rate a significant improvement in the current account with three consecutive years of trade surpluses strong foreign exchange reserve buffers markedly reduced lending rates and appreciable job creation according to the  business tracker survey conducted by the ghana statistical service in collaboration with the united nations development programme undp and the world bank the  pandemic has led to job losses with many ghanaian businesses and firms being forced to cut costs by reducing staff hours cutting wages and in some cases laying off workers this survey again showed that about seven hundred and seventy thousand  workers had their wages reduced and about fortytwo thousand  employees were laid off during the threeweek partial lockdown imposed on the greater accra and greater kumasi metropolitan areas and their contiguous districts tema and kasoa government however succeeded in protecting the jobs and incomes of all public sector workers indeed the cost of  has been enormous our overall economic growth rate for  was revised downwards from  to  the nonoil economy was also revised from  to  revenue shortfall was estimated at gh¢ billion with additional expenditures related to stemming the tide of  estimated at gh¢ billion with the combined effect amounting to gh¢ billion or  of gdp the resultant fiscal deficit for  was thus revised from  of gdp to  of gdp this was done to reflect the impact of the pandemic the fiscal responsibility rule of keeping a deficit within a threshold of  of gdp and a positive primary balance for every year was suspended in  to enable fiscal operations accommodate the impact of the pandemic i indicated at the time that we know what to do to bring the economy back to life what we do not know how to do is to bring people back to life that is why government did not hesitate to institute measures to protect the lives and livelihoods of ghanaians even if it was to the temporary detriment of our much soughtafter fiscal stability the formulation and implementation of the  preparedness and response plan tracing testing treatment waiver of personal income tax and provision of an additional fifty percent  basic salary allowance to healthcare workers expanding the capacities of laboratories to increase  testing establishment of isolation centres in all regions and districts fumigation of markets and schools provision of food packages and hot meals for residents in areas affected by the partial lockdown provision of free water for all households provision of free electricity for lifeline consumers and a fifty percent  discount for all other consumers reduction in the communication service tax cst from nine percent  to five percent  the institution of a seven hundred and fifty million cedi gh¢ million loan facility for micro small and medium enterprises through the capbus initiative and the provision of a two billion cedi gh¢ billion guarantee facility to support large businesses such as schools and pharmaceutical companies are amongst the several measures put in place by government to cushion ghanaians from the impact of the pandemic support has also been forthcoming from the bank of ghana under its brilliant leadership which has lowered the monetary policy rate by one hundred and fifty  basis points to  percent reduced the primary reserve requirement from ten percent  to eight percent  reduced the capital adequacy requirement from thirteen percent  to elevenpoint five percent  and reduced interest rates based on the ghana reference rate by two hundred  basis points the ghana revenue authority has also extended the dates for filing of taxes from four  months to six  months after the end of the basis year issued a waiver on vat national health insurance levy and getfund levy on donations of equipment and goods for fighting the pandemic waived income taxes on thirdtier pension withdrawals and permitted the deduction of contributions and donations towards  as allowable expense for tax purposes mr speaker my government found the resources to cushion the impact of the pandemic because we are good managers of the economy and we are good protectors of the public purse mr speaker the pandemic has exposed the need to expedite the process of moving ghana to a situation beyond aid that is why government has developed and is currently implementing the one hundredbillioncedi gh¢ billion ghana cares obaatampa programme to transform revitalise and modernise our economy and return it to high and sustained growth for the next three years the key projects under the cares programme include a supporting commercial farming and attracting educated youth into commercial farming b building the

establishing ghana as a regional hub  g reviewing and optimising the implementation of government flagships and key programmes and  h creating jobs for young people and expanding opportunities for the vulnerable in society including persons with disabilities the establishment of the national development bank under the ghana cares programme is expected to provide support to businesses in ghana government expects economic activity which has already picked up to do so even further following the ongoing vaccination exercise and the easing of restrictions put in place to curb the effects of the disease we expect gdp growth to rebound strongly this year to nearly five percent  above the imfs  january projection of  growth for subsaharan africa for  the mediumterm outlook supported by the implementation of the ghana cares programme is bright we are confident that together we will emerge from the  pandemic with a stronger and more resilient economy mr speaker if we are to oversee the rebirth and growth of our economy our people must be healthy and not succumb to  on  february government secured the first batch of vaccine doses from the covax facility the vaccination campaign is currently ongoing with two hundred and sixtytwo thousand three hundred and thirtyfive  number of ghanaians receiving the first dose of the vaccines as at  this morning the target is to vaccinate twenty million ghanaians and government is working hard towards realising this goal we remain on course to taking delivery of some seventeen million six hundred thousand vaccine doses by june with more to come in the course of the year i want to urge members of the house to lend their voices to the public education campaign currently ongoing with regards to the vaccination programme the vaccine together with strict compliance with the safety protocols is what will allow us to open up our country again and embark on the quest to restore normalcy to our lives and livelihoods government is also mindful of a problem associated with vaccinations and that is how to dispose of used ppes vials needles and syringes that are being used in the vaccination exercise government is collaborating with the private sector to establish fourteen  medical waste treatment facilities across the country to help address once and for all the safe disposal of medical waste  the pandemic has emphasized the need to expand access to healthcare for every ghanaian irrespective of his or her location and i want to thank again and again all our frontline healthcare workers for their devotion to duty and sense of patriotism the great amount of work undertaken by government has meant that we presently have some three hundred and seven  functioning and wellequipped ambulances under the oneconstituencyoneambulance initiative supported by a stateoftheart digitised command centre to field emergency calls and to dispatch ambulances last year thirtythree  major health projects were approved for implementation at a cost of eight hundred and ninety million euros € million key amongst them are the koforidua regional hospital tema general hospital the nephrology and urology centre

centre fertility centre neonatology and pediatric centre neurosurgery and spine centre stroke center heart and kidney centre and mental health centre to name a few  continuously upgrade our medical curriculum and continue to train our young doctors and health care professionals in a world class fashion  incentivise the private sector to increase capacity to support demand in healthcare delivery and  encourage ghanaian medical experts in the diaspora to collaborate and join hands with us to help build and contribute to the realisation of this noble vision the west african region is estimated to reach a population of half a billion people by  by which time this vision would have been realised government will continue to invest in the health sector and will continue to recruit more health professionals in addition to the one hundred thousand recruited in my first term for our health facilities electronic medical records system ehealth deployment is currently underway following its implementation in key health facilities like korlebu komfoanokye ho tamale and cape coast teaching hospitals and several district hospitals in the central region upper east upper west and bono regional hospitals will go live on the ehealth platform in five  days mr speaker when it was needed most at the height of the pandemic the ingenuity and creativity of the ghanaian shone through which caught the attention of the world when ppes were being sold on the world market at extortionist prices largely because demand outstripped supply we began producing them in ghana scrubs medical gowns sanitisers masks and gloves all of these essential to the fight against  were produced in ghana in total fourteen million six hundred thousand pieces of personal protective equipment have so far been produced domestically for health workers students teaching and nonteaching staff of tertiary and secondary educational institutions we are determined to make our own things and the akufoaddo

the automotive development policy to set up in ghana so far volkswagen has produced one thousand one hundred and sixtyseven  vehicles sinotruk two hundred and seventysix  vehicles and our own kantanka has produced four hundred  vehicles the japanese conglomerate nissan has also started the assembly of vehicles in the country mr speaker our nations food resilience has been severely tested over the past year the closure of borders in the midst of the pandemic meant that we have had to depend largely on food we produced we have fared well under the circumstances largely as a result of the bold policies implemented by government since  such as the programme for planting for food and jobs rearing for food and jobs the  initiative  policy establishment of greenhouse villages revitalisation of the cocoa rehabilitation programme and the reactivation of our aquaculture industry i am happy to inform the house that during this period of the pandemic we have experienced no food shortages in the country there have been increases in maize and rice yields by one hundred and ten percent  and fortyeight percent  respectively we have for the first time in a long while become a net exporter of food as opposed to the days of importation of tomatoes and plantain indeed in  we exported some one hundred and forty thousand metric tons  mt to our neighbours we are determined to take full advantage of african continental free trade area afcfta to produce more in ghana to sell more to africa and beyond as we move ghana beyond aid  the agreement for a strategic partnership between ghana and cote divoire has bound our two countries in even closer intimacy especially in the cocoa sector we have succeeded in aligning the cocoa production and marketing policies of the two countries and ensured that we do not continue to be victims or pawns of a global cocoa industry that is dependent on the toil and effort of our farmers a new trading mechanism has been implemented and has ensured that a new cost item of four hundred united states dollars  per ton for every cocoa sold by the two nations effective from the  season is paid to our farmers through the establishment of the tree crops development authority government is determined to end the overreliance on cocoa and develop other cash crops such as cashew cotton mango oil palm rubber and shea  government remains committed to the completion of the miniharbours and landing sites which are at different stages of completion in senya beraku dixcove elmina moree winneba gomoa fetteh teshie keta mumford and jamestown mr speaker i am passionate about the education of every child in ghana because education opens doors that is why one of my biggest concerns during this pandemic has been to safeguard the education of our children all over the world governments were forced to shut down schools as we did however we took steps to ensure that the education of our children was not truncated last year bold and responsible decisions made it possible for jhs  and shs  students to take their final examinations and final year university students graduated currently all our children from kindergarten to university are in school studying in conditions of safety this has taken place despite the outcry and opposition of some i am required to provide leadership and that is what i am doing government through the ministries of education and health is doing all it can to ensure that the future of our children is not jeopardised by the pandemic in  the first batch of free shs students wrote their wassce successfully results of the  wassce indicates that more than fifty percent  of candidates who sat the examination obtained  to  in all core subjects this was an impressive wassce performance with over sixty percent  of candidates scoring between  and  in their best six subjects including english and mathematics which qualifies them for tertiary education sixtyfour  years after independence we still do not have the critical mass of tertiary education graduates that is required for our socioeconomic transformation currently ghanas gross tertiary enrolment ratio stands at  which albeit very low is still one of the highest in africa we must therefore introduce measures to increase consciously the proportion of our population with relevant tertiary education to accelerate the transformation of our country our target is to increase the ratio from the current  to  by  focusing on science technology engineering and mathematics stem related fields with emphasis on engineering this will be achieved by significantly increasing enrolment in existing public and private universities and through the establishment of an open university we expect record numbers of enrolment over the next four  years accordingly we will fulfil our campaign manifesto promise by removing the guarantor requirement that makes it difficult for most students to apply for loans through the student loan trust fund programme as part of our commitment to the advancement of stem government will continue with the development of twenty  stem centres and eight  model science senior high schools across the country these institutions will be fitted with stateofthe art equipment and laboratories which will facilitate teaching and learning in all areas including artificial intelligence and robotics mr speaker i want to thank this august house for passing the education regulatory bodies act  act  the passage of this act has established the commission for technical vocational education and training ctvet and the tvet service all these will help to streamline delivery of tvet and avoid overlaps and duplication we are also building thirtytwo  tvet institutions across the country to augment existing infrastructure for effective tvet delivery in line with our commitment to address the issue of youth unemployment through tvet government will commence the implementation of the ghana jobs and skills project this year this project seeks to expedite the development of competencybased training curricula on the national tvet qualification framework for one hundred  tradesprofessions from level one  national proficiency  to level five  higher national diploma as well as training some twentyfive thousand  beneficiaries and provide entrepreneurial support to about fifty thousand  individuals it will also seek to implement the ghana labour market information system and upgrade of district public employment centres and services a key objective of our effort to improve quality education and ensure that our students become globally competitive is to maintain the integrity of our examinations and assessment in connection with this government working through waec will introduce new measures to curb examination leakages and malpractices i acknowledge that the teacher is at the centre of every reform in the field of education prioritising the welfare of teachers remains a key objective of government after the restoration of teacher training allowances government is now paying professional allowances to both teaching and nonteaching staff i am happy to announce that government is facilitating the acquisition of two hundred and eighty thousand laptops for members of the ghana national association of teachers gnat the national association of graduate teachers nagrat and the coalition of concern teachers cct this year moving forward the minister for education will soon detail an action plan for the implementation of the national teacher policy government has also introduced several interventions at the high school level some of these are the one hundred and ninetyeight million cedi gh¢ million academic intervention support programme dedicated for extra classes for students in shs implementation of free internet connectivity for secondary schools full absorption of bece registration fee for all for students in public junior high school from  till date and full absorption of wassce registration fees for students which started last year mr speaker our effort at digitisation is gathering steam when my government assumed office in  we faced the challenge of a largely informal economy the features of the informal economy included the absence of unique identification for citizens and residents of ghana and the absence of a working property address system across the country further only a small proportion of our population was registered by the ghana revenue authority gra with tax identification numbers tins and by ssnit for social security seventy percent  of the adult population did not have access to a bank account financial transactions were dominated by cash and the processes of service delivery in most mmdas were largely manual and highly bureaucratic it was in this context that we set about the process of formalizing our informal economy through digitisation  mr speaker after four years in office i am happy to state that there has been more progress in formalising the ghanaian economy than there was in the previous sixty  years since independence mr speaker for the first time we have enrolled  million people onto the national id card system the ghanacard and we will complete the process this year from  april and this is not an april fools prank all national id numbers will become tax identification numbers in so doing the number of people registered by gra for tax purposes will increase from the current three million  million to  million i should recall that at the end of  only  people had tin numbers the increase to  million in just four years is simply phenomenal similarly from the  quarter of this year all national id numbers will also become ssnit numbers this will increase the number of people on the ssnit database from four million  million to  million making it easier for new contributors to be enlisted on the scheme the national id numbers will also become nhis numbers very soon we will link the national id to all sim cards bank accounts births and deaths registry dvla documents and passports mr speaker for the first time through the implementation of the digital property addressing system every location in ghana has a digital address the process of affixing unique property address plates for some  million properties in all sixteen  regions has also started mr speaker for the first time in ghana more than seventy percent  of the population has access to financial services either through a bank account or a mobile money account we have been able to do so through the implementation of mobile money interoperability between bank accounts and mobile wallets with ghana as the first and only country in africa to have done so it is therefore not surprising that ghana is the fastest growing mobile money market in africa furthermore our successful introduction of the universal qr quick response code for payments across banks telcos fintechs and merchants will propel ghana to be amongst the first countries in africa if not the first to move towards a largely cashless economy when fully rolled out across the country with the support of the bank of ghana mr speaker we have also digitised the operations of many government institutions including the ports nhis dvla gra and the passport office one of the most dramatic examples of this development has been the ability of ssnit to pay pensions within ten  days of application as opposed to the endless delays of the past to make it easy to obtain government services a portal ghanagov has been established where all mmdas are being onboarded it is a one stop shop where anyone can apply for and pay for a government service we expect to complete the onboarding of all mmdas this year and in so doing significantly enhance the efficiency and reduce the cost of delivery of government services to our people  the integrated customs management systems icums which is an endtoend customs management system at the ports to enhance management and collection of customs duties has despite initial resistance and controversy succeeded in eliminating the multiple routes prior to payment of duties ensuring seamless processes increasing revenues and speedy processing of premanifest declaration and valuation on the same system we have also integrated the ghanagov platform and the integrated tax application preparation systems itaps which allow taxpayers to make payments at their convenience online and through taxpayers banks and the use of mobile money credit cards and debit cards mr speaker it is clear that we have made significant strides in formalising the economy and we will do even more going forward mr speaker our judicial system has not been left out of the digitisation programme today the ejustice and ecase register initiatives for example are helping to ensure that the law keeps pace with technology ending the ageold missing dockets phenomenon and endless litigations which have plagued the efficient delivery of justice in the country for many many years government through the ministry of local government and the district assembly common fund has commenced in an unprecedented initiative the construction of ninety  courts with accompanying accommodation for judges across the country to help address the problem of inadequate court infrastructure these structures are at advanced stages of completion again through the same medium twenty  townhouses and a guesthouse are being built to be used as permanent residences for court of appeal judges based in kumasi who are mandated to handle cases in the northern part of the country with the coming into force of the courts regulation  li  on  december  the relevant sections of the courts act act  have been amended and has led to an expansion of the jurisdiction of the lower courts indeed prior to the amendment the monetary values of cases that could be heard by the district and circuit courts were twenty thousand gh¢ and fifty thousand cedis gh¢ respectively today the district courts jurisdiction over cases brought before it has been increased to five hundred thousand cedis gh¢ whereas that of the circuit court has been increased to two million cedis gh¢ million mr speaker this increase in jurisdiction will ensure that more cases are heard in the district and circuit courts thus easing the burden on the high courts all these measures will go a long way to enhance justice delivery in the country and help consolidate the rule of law mr speaker when i appeared before this house on  january  to deliver the last message on the state of the nation at the dissolution of parliament i called for a national discourse on the longstanding issue of illegal smallscale mining in our country yes in the last four years so much has been achieved in cleaning up this industry training miners in the best methods of mining introducing community mining enacting additional regulatory legislation but the reality is that illegal smallscale mining remains a major problem i am confident that the new energetic minister for lands and natural resources and member of parliament for damongo constituency hon samuel abu jinapor will rapidly facilitate the holding of this national dialogue and will work to build on the progress of his predecessors by enhancing regulation of this sector which should be anchored on the protection of the environment and on community mining  mr speaker let me at this point assure the house that in the course of this session of parliament government will come back to engage the house on the steps it intends to take on the future of

all land records for purposes of ensuring effective land administration aggressive afforestation will be pursued in the course of the year with the expected launch of a green ghana project which will see the mobilisation of ghanaians in all fields of endeavour to participate in a nationwide tree planting exercise  mr speaker in  ghana won the bid to host and organise the  african games for the first time since the tournament started in  a nine  member local organizing committee has been constituted and inaugurated to handle the technical and events aspects of the  africa games government intends to provide maximum support to the loc to help ensure we organise and host successful games   the construction of ten  youth resource centres yrc across the country which are at different

uganda by two goals to zero on sunday in nouakchott capital of the republic of mauritania ayekoo to the black satellites and to the technical and management teams i look forward to receiving them at

environment government is also determined to provide the funding necessary for the judicial committees of the various houses of chiefs to be able to do their work effectively and efficiently so as to bring closure to many longstanding chieftaincy disputes   mr speaker our nation continues to benefit from the year of return since then we have intensified our engagement with africans in the diaspora

housing company ltd for completion   mr speaker it is my intention to place special emphasis on resolving the problems of the housing sector in the country because tackling the housing deficit is long overdue   mr speaker one of the ministries created in my first term as president was the ministry of railways development and the benefits of its creation are showing government is mobilising some two billion dollars  billion towards the development of railway infrastructure and services  to this end government has rehabilitated a section of the narrowgauge western line from kojokrom to tarkwa

diplomas in engineering and other related courses   mr speaker in my inaugural address i declared  as the second year of roads this declaration is intended to continue to prioritise road construction so that road projects that started under the sinohydro facility will be completed as will interchanges that are at various stages of completion specific details of the road projects are going to be outlined in the budget that will be read on friday  mr speaker cabinet has granted policy approval for the establishment of a national flag carrier home based airline with strategic partner participation the house will be duly informed on developments in this area construction of the second and third phases of the kumasi airport second phase of tamale airport and rehabilitation of the sunyani airport are all proceeding satisfactorily a decision on the siting of the proposed airport in the central and western regions is imminent   mr speaker in order to revive the fortunes of the metro mass public transport system government has provided a total of one hundred  new intercity buses for metro mass transit limited mmtl and an additional one hundred  buses for the intercity stc coaches limited the construction of a new dedicated container terminal at the tema port is ongoing and three  out of the four  berths have been completed to facilitate maritime and inland waterways transportation   the development of a multipurpose container terminal at the takoradi port is progressing removal of tree stumps along the navigable pathway at the dambai to dambaioverbank yejimakango and yejiaworjekope has been completed to improve the safety of navigation and reduce accidents on the volta lake the construction of ferry landing sites along the volta lake at dambai and dambai overbank is sixtyeight  complete whilst that of yeji makango and agodeke is fortysix percent  complete in total seven  rescue and highspeed patrol boats have been procured by the ghana maritime authority and deployed into service to improve safety and security of our maritime domain and inland waterways  mr speaker our security services have been retooled and reequipped substantially under this administration indeed the first four  units of four  storey blocks of sixteen  flats under the barracks regeneration project have been commissioned and the remaining part of a forty   selfcontained accommodation units for the sixbattalion of infantry and airborne force in tamale have also been completed pickups suvs trucks high occupancy buses ambulances and armored personnel carriers apcs have been added to the inventory of the armed forces over the period as well as the imminent completion of a forward operating base fob at ezinlibo in the jomoro district of the western

the capacity of the ghana national fire service has been raised with the procurement of five  sets of extrication equipment and two  hydraulic platforms procured   indeed when i took office in january  the police service had a total of four hundred and ninetytwo  serviceable cars government has since then procured for the police some seven hundred and thirtyfive  additional vehicles including fifteen  operational buses a feat unprecedented in the history of the service three hundred and twenty  housing units are being constructed at national police training school to reduce the accommodation deficits of the service modern communication equipment and fragmentation jackets have been procured and delivered to the service to protect officers and ensure effective policing the construction of hangers at the police depot accra for four  helicopters already procured for the ghana police service is ninetynine percent  complete an airwing unit has been established by the ghana

odorkor in accra for the immigration service are ninetyeight percent  complete and their completion will help reduce the accommodation challenges faced by officers and men of the immigration service   government is also constructing an eight hundred  inmate capacity remand prison at nsawam which is sixty percent  complete its purpose is to reduce further overcrowding in prisons as remand prisoners will now be kept separately from the convict population   mr speaker these large investments in equipping our security services is inspired by the recognition that the peace and stability of our nation are critical for our development especially as we live in a difficult and sometimes dangerous world   mr speaker amongst the milestones of our international relations i have been reappointed chairman of the authority of ecowas for a second term under my leadership and in collaboration with colleagues in the region we have restored peace and political stability to mali through a landmark transitional arrangement which brought under control a period of bloodshed and uncertainty and which has committed itself to a roadmap for a peaceful democratic outcome from the transition  in addition to strengthening cooperation and deepening bilateral and multilateral trade and economic ties with host countries it is exciting to note that presidential visits overseas have yielded significant dividends the reestablishment of the economic trade and investment bureau of the ministry has enabled the positioning of the ministry as a strategic partner to help facilitate domestic and foreign investments in the country indeed the ghana investment promotion centre has reported today a surge in foreign direct investment into our country of  billion in  compared to  billion the previous year representing a more than ninety percent  increase  mr speaker the sum total of all of this is that in spite of the ravages of the pandemic our nation is still very much in rude health and remains very attractive to investors yes we are reeling from the effects of  but i am confident that with the progress of the vaccination programme we will recover quickly and work towards putting our nation back onto the path of progress and prosperity we are building a more inclusive society and soon things will work for all in ghana and then we will fulfill our true potential as the black star of africa  crucial to achieving this vision is my uncompromising commitment to strengthening the institutions of our democracy and managing public resources with integrity fairness openness and accountability  ours is not a government that shies away from public scrutiny far from it that is not the npp way that is why in  under the outstanding leadership of the  president of the  republic his excellency john agyekum kufuor and with me as his attorney general the criminal libel law was repealed to protect and expand media freedoms in the country and in  the public procurement act was introduced to protect the public purse that is why it was my government that took the bold steps in  to bring about the establishment of an independent prosecutor with the setting up of the office of special prosecutor that is why it was my government that in  enacted the right to information act which had been shirked by previous administrations despite decades of agitation by journalists and civil society groups that is why within two years of being in office we more than doubled funding for accountability institutions of state like chraj eoco the judiciary and the auditor general government and the people expect those in charge of our governance institutions to do their work with professionalism and good faith  indeed the institutions of our nation whether the executive legislature or judiciary are working the supreme court for example last week determined the challenge to the validity of the  presidential election and affirmed its validity in a unanimous decision the court has spoken it is time for all of us to move on and in a united manner confront the problems of postcovid ghana  let me in conclusion mr speaker recall the following statement i made in my very first message on the state of the nation on the ghana i hoped to help construct a statement which is at the heart of everything government has sought to do since i took office in   this ghana will be defined by integrity sovereignty a common ethos discipline and shared values it is one where we aim to be masters of our own destiny where we mobilise our own resources for the future breaking the shackles of the guggisberg colonial economy and a mindset of dependency bailouts and extraction it is an economy where we look past commodities to position ourselves in a global marketplace it is a country where we focus on trade not aid a handup not a handout it is a country with a strong private sector it is a country that recognises the connectedness of its people and economy to those of its neighbours this requires a forwardlooking vision for our country enabling us to confront our challenges and embrace our opportunities not one fastened in the rearview mirror it is a ghana beyond aid mr speaker i remain wholly committed to fulfillment of this vision may god bless us all and our homeland ghana and make her great and strong i thank you for your attention      ghana is a west african country bound on the north by burkina faso on the east by togo on the south by the atlantic oceanand on the west by côte divoire jubilee house kanda accra  infopresidencygovgh    \n",
      "message on the state of the nation by the president of the republic nana addo dankwa akufoaddo on wednesday  march  at parliament house accra it is always an honour and a pleasure to be back here where i was a threetime member to give a message on the state of the nation as required by the constitution mr speaker i hope you will forgive me if i begin by asking members of the house to join me to salute the management technical and playing teams of the black stars who against the odds beat the super eagles of nigeria in abuja yesterday their qualification for the world cup in qatar has brought so much joy to ghanaians and we are looking forward to an outstanding performance in qatar in accordance with protocol and convention it is good to see that first lady rebecca akufoaddo vice president mahamudu bawumia second lady samira bawumia spouse of mr speaker madam alice adjua yornas chief justice anin yeboah spouse of the chief justice madam phyllis ofori and justices of the supreme court chairperson nana otuo siriboe ii and members of the council of state chief of defence staff vice admiral seth amoama inspector general of police dr george akuffodampare and service chiefs are all present mr speaker the house is duly honoured by the welcome attendance virtually of the former president of the republic his excellency john agyekum kufuor former first lady her excellency nana konadu agyemang rawlings and the dean and members of the diplomatic corps mr speaker from my vantage point as president of the republic from the focused point as head of government from the enviable position of a husband a father and a grandfather i know that there is a general sense of anxiety in our nation at the moment the ghanaian people are anxious about the economy the cost of living income levels jobs for young people and even about issues on which we all thought we had achieved a national consensus when some amongst us are raising questions about the certainties on which we are building the state it is not surprising that worries about the stability of the government would become cause for heightened tension in the nation mr speaker two years ago to the day we were in the midst of a lockdown in the main metropolitan centres of our country we were truly in the midst of the unknown it took a while before it even got a name but a pandemic it was and the only certainty about it was that nobody knew very much about it the scientists the health experts and the world health organisation were all united in their view that the virus would cause a lot of devastation the world before covid now seems such a long time ago and the trauma of a world ruled by a pandemic has changed all our perspectives back in march  when the first cases of covid hit our country we and the rest of the world were in unchartered territory fear and sheer terror gripped our land probably to future generations it will look quite obvious what should have been done but two years ago it felt like we had fallen into a dark malicious and terrifying abyss we could not have been prepared for the catastrophe that hit us even the richest economies with the most sophisticated structures were unprepared maybe some of us have forgotten what the experts were predicting at the time our health and medical infrastructure was woefully inadequate and we would not be able to cope there were going to be piles of dead bodies strewn across the streets of africa there was a general consensus that we should spend all our energies and resources on protecting lives i remember for example the discussions about ppes two  years ago nobody was asking or was interested in how much they cost just find them for our health workers and that was the only consideration i wonder how many people remember the cost of the first face shields and nose masks that came into our country i took the decision we would prioritize the saving of lives and then we would get together to rebuild our economy nobody imagined the devastation would be so widespread and last so long we have had our share of covid deniers and conspiracy theorists but it is fair to say mr speaker that our management of the covid outbreak has been exemplary and has been so acclaimed by the world and with the great mercies of the almighty we have saved lives indeed the total number of deaths we have sadly recorded one thousand four hundred and fortyfive  represents a miniscule fraction of the total number of deaths on the african continent  i remember a year ago we were in the midst of the second wave of covid infections and deaths there was widespread fear again there was consensus we should concentrate all attention and resources on protecting lives by that time a little more was known about the virus and the anxiety had shifted to the provision of vaccines we moved rapidly to secure the provision of vaccines first for the frontline officials and workers and those most atrisk and then to the general mass of the population always relying on the current scientific thinking we had to learn some very hard lessons and our belief in the need for selfsufficiency was reinforced when vaccine nationalism was played out blatantly by the rich and powerful countries mr speaker the presidential vaccine manufacturing committee which i set up to respond to this obvious deficiency has put in place a comprehensive strategy for domestic vaccine production and the establishment of a national vaccine institute to implement the strategy which will enable us to begin the first phase of commercial production in january  a bill will shortly be brought to you in this house for your support and approval for the establishment of the national vaccine institute this pandemic exposed other shortcomings of our country which have undoubtedly contributed to the anxieties that have befallen the nation agenda  was born out of this necessity to address some of these shortcomings at the normal rate of growth we are not likely to make up the deficit in our health facilities infrastructure for a very long time hence the need for a special dedicated programme of infrastructural development we are undertaking the construction of  entities which comprise standard  district hospitals for one hundred and one  districts without hospitals with accommodation for doctors and nurses six  new regional hospitals for each of the six  new regions the rehabilitation of the effiankwanta hospital in the western region one  new regional hospital for the western region and three  psychiatric hospitals for each of the three  zones of the country ie north middle and coastal it is an ambitious project which must and will be done and which will create some thirtythree thousand nine hundred  jobs for construction workers and on completion some thirtyfour thousand three hundred  jobs for health workers mr speaker i have to report that like all major construction projects it is evident that the initial schedule we gave for the completion of agenda  was overly ambitious identifying suitable sites around the country for example has turned out to be even more problematic than had been anticipated i am able to say that a great deal of the preparatory work has now been completed and work has started at eightyseven  of the one hundred and eleven  sites i have been assured that preliminary work on the remaining twentyfour  sites is ongoing we have every intention of seeing this project through to a successful end which will enable me to commission all one hundred and eleven  hospitals before i leave office on  january  mr speaker we have saved lives and fared much better than we had feared and the experts predicted but the consequences of lockdowns border and business closures and unplanned expenditures have combined to have a devastating impact on our economy the unplanned expenditures included but were not limited to the recruitment on a permanent basis of fiftyeight thousand one hundred and ninetyone  healthcare professionals and the payment of extra incentives to our frontline health workers it took an unbudgeted gh¢ billion to ensure that our children and teaching staff went back and stayed in school safely some including a few in this honourable house went as far as to accuse the government of trying to kill ghanaian children when we introduced the controlled school reopenings i might add here that in some countries school closures have lasted for twenty  months and children are only now going back to school our children did not lose a single academic year we provided nearly five million  million households and over ten million  million people with electricity and water subsidies at the time they were most needed in all data from the ministry of finance tells us that an amount of gh¢ billion or  of gdp has been spent in containing the pandemic since  mr speaker the npp government came into office with a plan to build a resilient economy and set us on the path to prosperity we were on course and our performance between  and the beginning of  demonstrates we were making rapid progress indeed in   and  we recorded average annual gdp growth rates of  making us one of the fastest growing economies in the world we grew the economy from the cedi equivalent of fiftyfour billion united states dollars  billion at the end of  to the cedi equivalent of seventytwo billion dollars  billion in  a thirtythree percent  increase then covid arrived this is not something that anyone could have planned for and the consequences are there for us all to see around the world the big and established economies of the world have been knocked off their planned trajectory countries where budget deficits were unknown and prohibited by law suddenly had to accept huge deficits to underwrite social cohesion the economic devastation of covid has since the beginning of this year been further aggravated by the russian invasion of ukraine which has worsened the economic outlook of the entire world we in ghana have not escaped this development and the consequences are being felt in rising living costs at our markets and at fuel stations the terrible events in ukraine have a direct impact on our lives here in ghana mr speaker thirty percent  of our wheat flour and fertilizer imports come from russia sixty percent  of iron rods and other metal sheets are imported from ukraine and almost twenty percent  of ghanas manganese is shipped to ukraine the bombs might be dropping on cities half a world away but they are hitting our pockets here in ghana even so we have managed to ensure that fuel supplies have not been disrupted unlike in several other parts of the world last week the minister for finance spelt out in detail to the country the economic and fiscal difficulties we face and the raft of measures we are introducing to bring relief and restore us to economic growth the measures that have been announced by the minister for finance are meant to demonstrate that we are aware that we are in difficult times and we are addressing the situation the belttightening measures being set for members of the executive have been elaborated within this context this government remains alive to its responsibilities to the ghanaian people the difficulties of the time notwithstanding we intend to continue to grow this economy and bring prosperity that will only happen when we continue to invest in the future our children will continue to be educated and be equipped to run a modern and digitalized economy the free shs and free tvet are the best vehicles we have devised to take us to the realization of our goal of an educated and skilled workforce the computerized school placement is currently ongoing and the latest batch of jhs students will soon embark on their free shs and free tvet education the tvet institutions are being upgraded and equipped to enable them train the increased numbers of children that we want to be attracted to that sector to meet the modern needs of our economy this year i will be commissioning some of the thirtyfour  refurbished national vocational and technical institutes nvtis across the country the refurbishment comprised the construction rehabilitation and equipping of laboratories workshops additional classrooms hostels and administrative offices within the next few months the construction of five  technical colleges will begin in various parts of the country three technical institutes will be upgraded to tertiary status the initial phase for the construction of nine  tvet campuses will commence next month in bosomtwe akyem awisa boako kenyasi patuda dambai larabanga guabuliga and tolibri these campuses will have academic facilities workshops laboratories hostels and staff accommodation and provide further access for training government is in the process of securing financing for the construction of five  stem universities in five  new regions that is western north savannah north east ahafo and oti regions steps are being taken to turn the planned bunso campus of the university of environment and sustainable development into a standalone independent university focused on the study of engineering construction of this campus is set to begin within the next three  months mr speaker there is great potential for our people in the creative arts fashion and film industry we want to unleash the creativity enterprise and innovation of our youth by giving them education and skills training in the creative arts the creative arts senior high school in kwadaso whose construction is currently seventy percent  complete will serve as a beacon for many young and talented people seeking a fulfilling career in this field mr speaker i recall with nostalgia the end of year  just before the onset of covid when the world came to ghana in that december to remember and we were the happy place to be at the end of our year of return ghana continues to lead the push for african renaissance through the decadelong beyond the return project the december in gh component of this project has positioned ghana as the destination to visit every december last year the country recorded some six hundred and twentythree thousand five hundred and twentythree  visitors up from the three hundred and fiftyfive thousand one hundred and eight  visitors the year before signifying a marked rebound of our tourism sector we should recapture those glorious moments and build on them as we work hard to reclaim what we lost to the covid years government is therefore undertaking a comprehensive renovation and modernization of tourist attractions across the country such as the cape coast and elmina castles kwame nkrumah memorial park which will enable us position ghana as the preferred tourism destination in west africa mr speaker government is determined to make our country the place where hard work pays good dividends we have made substantial investments in the agriculture sector for example because we recognise this is where a substantial number of our people make a living the successes of the programme for planting for food and jobs have transformed the lives of many farmers around the country i am glad to announce that the tono irrigation dam has been fully rehabilitated and is back to life and fully operational and is serving the needs of many farmers in the areas around the dam the result of significant investment by my government in the ghana commercial agriculture project has resulted in the availability of a total of thirteen thousand one hundred and ninety  hectares of additional irrigable land through the rehabilitation of tono kpong left bank and kpong irrigation schemes for rice and vegetable cultivation immediate benefits arising from the scheme include improved rice yields increasing from  tons per hectare to  tons per hectare leading to increased production and growth in farm incomes this has benefitted some fourteen thousand two hundred and sixtyfour  smallholder beneficiaries directly creating some forty thousand  jobs along several value chain activities generated from the irrigation schemes in particular at the kpong left bank irrigation project government through the ministry of food and agriculture has recently engaged nine  large scale investors in addition to smallholder farmers at the kpong left bank irrigation project klbip who would be producing rice maize and vegetables on one thousand three hundred hectares  using modern production technologies to achieve improved productivity and production within the next three  months government has also invested in the vegetable sector through the ghana periurban vegetable value chain project we have provided irrigation infrastructure covering a total of five hundred and fortyone  hectares which directly impacts vegetable farmers in the greater accra region in addition to these farmers we have also provided inputs and technical support to vegetable farmers at hikpo in the volta region and asokwa in the ashanti region the project has provided offtaker arrangements for both domestic and international markets the construction of eighty  warehouses with a combined storage capacity of eightythousand metric tonnes  has been completed and their entry into the food production chain is offering better protection to the harvests of farmers there is no doubt that but for the vigorous interventions we have made in agriculture in the past five years which have made us more selfreliant in our food needs our country would have been at much greater risk as the fallout from the dramatic worldwide increases in freight charges hit prices in our markets and on our supermarket shelves mr speaker the cocoa industry has marked a lot of interesting and farreaching achievements this past year including producing one million and fortyseven thousand three hundred and eightyfive tonnes  the highest ever recorded in ghanas history together with our counterparts in cote divoire we have addressed the inequalities in the international marketing system of cocoa by paying a living income differential of four hundred united states dollars  per tonne of cocoa to our farmers this is a remarkable initiative that cushions the income of the ghanaian cocoa farmer the backbone of our economy i want to draw attention to one other innovation in the industry that appears to be a small item a nonadjustable electronic weighing scale has been introduced for the purchase of cocoa from our cocoa farmers this scale which was introduced at the start of the cocoa season in october has been approved by the ghana standards authority it cannot be tampered with by purchasers not many people outside the cocoa industry will realise the significance of the introduction of this little bit of technology but it brings to an end one of the main sources of distrust between cocoa farmers and officialdom the ageold beliefsuspicion that cocoa farmers are being cheated by tampering with the weighing machines has come to an end the same use of technology to attract more young people into agriculture is continuing with the training of five hundred and thirtyseven  youth in the production of high value vegetables using greenhouse technology one hundred and ninety  of them have been on an  internship in israel and they are back with a lot of enthusiasm we are expecting great things from them indeed mr speaker we are expecting greater things from the greater use of technology and the digitalization of our economy as a whole i am happy to report that the national identification card the ghana card has finally been integrated into our everyday lives as a cradletograve necessity never again will it be that someone born in this country will live a full life die and be buried without any record of his or her existence the operations of the births and deaths registry are finally being digitised to make sure that documents issued from that department are accorded the respect they should have every child born in this country will be registered and the date of birth registered will remain your date of birth throughout your life there will be no school age no football age no ssnit age and no official age when we register for national health insurance the details of our identification will be the same as the details on a driving licence a passport and yes on our tax identification today we all have addresses at which we can be identified even if we live unfortunately for the time being in a kiosk and when we die that inevitable rite of passage will be recorded to mark the end of our life mr speaker it is not enough that the state collects all this information it is critical that every citizen is able to benefit from the digitisation process the benefits range from being able to give directions to our address for deliveries and being able to gain access to government services without having to go to the ministries the rural telephony project being undertaken by gifec is working to fill the void created by the telephone operators inability or unwillingness to extend their services to areas they deem uneconomical to operate it is important to extend basic telephone voice and data connectivity to every part of the country so we leave no one behind mr speaker i have spoken on other occasions about the digitization of port operations or what we all now call the paperless port i am glad to say that the initial problems have largely been overcome and we are witnessing the advantages in faster processes at the port and less opportunities for corruption with the reduction of human interface icums when it was introduced provoked a lot of controversy at the moment we are seeing the benefits indeed customs revenue prior to the implementation of icums for the period june  to may  stood at gh¢ billion between june  the start of icums and may  teething challenges illconsidered propaganda and the impact of  on global trade notwithstanding customs revenue has increased by  to gh¢ billion indeed customs revenue for  stood at gh¢ billion as opposed to gh¢ billion in  when icums had not been implemented the digitisation of hospital records has started through the lightwave health information management system we started with the teaching hospitals and we plan to work in a phased approach to cover every health facility in ghana i am sure this will be a welcome innovation for all we have learnt the very hard way the first step to prosperity in africa is for our countries to trade among each other it is the reason we campaigned for and supported and proudly host the continental office of the afcta trading under the african continental free trade agreement afcfta officially commenced on  january  and ghana was the first country in africa to establish customs procedure codes to facilitate trading under the afcfta we have established a national afcfta coordination office to facilitate activities we have high hopes that the afcfta office which we proudly host will bring urgency to growing trade among the african states probably the most significant step towards making this intraafrican trade possible was taken in accra a few weeks ago with the launch of papss the panafrican payment and settlement system this is a leadingedge technology connecting african banks payment service providers and other financial market intermediaries to enable instant and secure payments between african countries it means a trader in ghana can order supplies in kenya with cedis and buy it in kenyan shillings and not have to go through dollars or euros or pounds sterling this will simplify the historical complexities and costs of making payments across african borders and provide operational efficiencies to open up vast economic opportunities for all stakeholders it means we have a simplified process that reduces the costs and complexities of foreign exchange for crossborder transactions between african markets and enables innovation in crossborder trade and access to new african markets mr speaker if we campaign so hard for the opening up of trading among african states we had better have something to sell i am glad to report that despite the adverse effects of the  pandemic on firmlevel production and productivity as well as the disruptions in global supply chains the manufacturing subsector showed significant recovery last year manufacturing recorded an average growth of  in the first half of  compared to  in the corresponding period in  at the beginning of the pandemic our flagship one district one factory  initiative is being implemented with business promoters being empowered and supported either to establish new factories or to transform existing manufacturing enterprises to contribute significantly to job creation across the country mr speaker through the  initiative the madeinghana label is being stamped on a wide range of products proudly manufactured in ghana out of a total of two hundred and seventyeight   projects at various stages of implementation in all the sixteen  regions one hundred and six  factories are currently operational one hundred and fortyeight  are under construction while twentyfour  projects are at mobilization stage mr speaker in order to bring the youth on board the  programme fiftyeight  out of the two hundred and seventyeight   projects have been developed as enterprises fully owned by youth groups with direct government support each of these  youth companies are owned by between forty  and fifty  youth as shareholders in addition five  medium scale stateoftheart agroprocessing commonuser facilities cufs have been established with direct support from government and are owned by various groups of farmers whose farming operations had previously been undermined through lack of processing facilities these farmerowned companies have been established in five  districts namely dormaa west savelugu sefwi akontonbra sekyere central and tarkwa nsuaem they cover oil palm processing rice milling and the processing of maize into maize grits mr speaker quite a number of global vehicle manufacturing companies have set up assembly plants here in our country and started producing vehicles for our market and for the west african market the welldefined ghana automotive development policy we outdoored in august  has facilitated this welcome development since june  toyota and suzuki brands of vehicles are being produced here commencing with the production of hilux pickup and swift models vw and sinotruck which commenced commercial operations in  have continued to assemble their brands of vehicles and are enjoying significant local patronage in addition a new stateoftheart assembly plant with capacity to assemble  new vehicles per annum has been established by nissan in tema which is currently producing nissan and peugeot brands of vehicles for the ghanaian and west african markets i will have the pleasure to commission this new plant in tema tomorrow three other vehicle manufacturers namely kia hyundai and renault are also expected to commence commercial production this year our national iconic automobile brand the kantanka brand produced by kantanka automobile company ltd also steppedup production of its madeinghana vehicles which include nkunimdie suv omama pickup onantefo  pickup otumfuo suv and  small suv models now that the minister for finance has announced an embargo on the importation of  vehicles for official use i hope the local assembly plants will take full advantage of the opportunity especially since government is continuing with its policy of giving first priority to locally assembled vehicles in respect of all publicly financed procurement of vehicles mr speaker we have proof beyond the education agriculture and manufacturing sectors to show that we have been using state revenue to expand infrastructure across other sectors and improve lives for the first time in our history we are doing something about the infrastructure needs of the judiciary on a major scale a courthouse is an essential element of the architecture of a state dedicated to the promotion of the rule of law and yet there are large areas of our country that are not served by any court and people have to travel long distances to access the services of a court unfortunately as a former chief justice once put it the conditions of most of the court facilities around the country where they exist are not fit for purpose we have thus embarked on a project to provide one hundred  courthouses and accompanying residences for judges and magistrates around the country fifty of them are being built and are near completion and should be handed over to the judiciary soon mr speaker one hundred and twentyone  residential units for the judiciary are also being built across the country furthermore twentytwo  new modern townhouses are being constructed at danyame in kumasi to address the accommodation challenges facing court of appeal judges assigned to the northern sector some of you might remember that work began some twenty years ago on the construction of law house a proposed new office accommodation for the office of attorneygeneral and ministry of justice a  edifice consisting of ten  floors above ground and two  storeys underground work on the project had stopped many years ago i am glad to say not only has the project been resurrected i am told it is expected to be completed by the end of this year mr speaker whilst on the subject of law enforcement the passage of the right to information act the witness protection act the amendment of the criminal offences act and other laws have enhanced significantly the capacity of the state in the fight against corruption it is also an undeniable fact that budgetary allocations for institutions actively engaged in public sector accountability ie the office of the auditorgeneral the judiciary parliament and the ghana police service have witnessed significant increases since i assumed office in  furthermore we now have a new special prosecutor who appears to have all the wherewithal necessary to exercise vigorously the prerogatives of his office mr speaker it is in the road sector that we have registered the greatest infrastructure achievement i know that the word unprecedented is often used with careless abandon in our public discourse but i use it carefully and purposefully in the five years of my government so far more roads have been built improved and upgraded than at any other equivalent period under any government in the history of ghana some ten thousand eight hundred and seventyfive  kilometres of new roads have been constructed in these five  years let me mention that yesterday it was my honour and great pleasure to have commissioned the tamale interchange the first such interchange in the northern sector of our country which the people of tamale celebrated i considered it to be a most satisfying birthday present we intend to continue with the building of roads round the country to accelerate the opening up of our country mr speaker we have kept to our promise and kept the lights on in spite of worldwide upheavals in the energy sector and in spite of the huge legacy debts we inherited we have almost completed the process of restructuring these debts to reduce their crippling effect on our public expenditure with the introduction of more bulk supply points bsps in areas such as kasoa and pokuase power transmission has improved tremendously in the southwestern and northwestern parts of greater accra power lines are getting upgraded to reduce commercial and technical losses and increase transmission capacity under the national electrification scheme a total of two hundred and seventynine  communities have been connected to the national grid this has increased the national electricity access rate from  percent in  to  percent as at january  four hundred and eightyseven  more communities are at various stages of connection and completion we are on course to achieve our ambition of universal access to electricity by the end of my term as the president of this country the accommodation problems facing the military have long been matters of national sadness i am glad to say that the first stage of the military housing project dubbed the barracks regeneration project has started with construction going on at all garrisons across the country the military academy at teshie is being modernized and we are keeping our armed forces retooled and equipped to enable them live up to their duties each of the different branches of the armed forces – the army navy and airforce – has received significant financial assistance to upgrade its logistical bases and strengthen its capabilities and its welfare requirements are being substantially addressed we are building modernised armed forces with higher numbers of personnel that will be fit to meet the demands of the  century the protection of our borders puts extra burden on the military especially since there is increased terrorist activity in the region and instability in many of our neighbouring countries fifteen  forward operating bases or fobs as they are called are being constructed across the country to help in the prevention of cross border crimes and terrorist activity mr speaker i believe we can all testify that our police service is undergoing a great improvement and a change of image before our very eyes during times of anxiety we need a responsive police service to boost the confidence of the population and it is good to see the police rise up to the challenge nothing starts people off in a bad mood more than the driving habits and traffic jams that create chaos on our roads and make every road journey a nightmare gradually the police are bringing order to the roads and we all now know that the law is no respecter of persons or vehicle types i urge all of us to cooperate with the police to perform their duties to enable all of us go about our lives in peace i am happy to state that government has been able to provide much needed modern equipment for the service and we are tackling their accommodation needs as well we are constructing three hundred and twenty  housing units at the national police training school which are at an advanced stage of completion work is also ongoing on the construction of a huge barracks complex at kwabenya to replace the one adjacent to the dvla at  where the conditions of living are poor mr speaker together with the implementation of a number of operational and personnel welfare interventions the morale of police officers has received a considerable boost and today publicfocused interventions instituted by the igp have resulted in a better policepublic relationship the police service is gradually regaining the trust and confidence of the public under the leadership of its new igp mr speaker as i indicated last year would happen a national dialogue on illegal mining was held under the auspices of the lands and natural resources ministry in accra as well as two other regional ones in kumasi and tamale if ever the support of all citizens was required to make something work it is in the battle to end illegal mining and restore our lands and water bodies to health we have declared river bodies and forest reserves as red zones for mining we have suspended the issuance of all prospecting exploration andor reconnaissance licenses for minerals in forest reserves launched operation halt ii to help rid our water bodies and forest reserves of illegal miners revamped the community mining scheme as more sustainable and greener safeguards to replace illegal mining what we need above all is the buyin of all citizens to recognize that the degradation caused to the lands and water bodies by the illegal mining practices affect each one of us and we should all take an interest to stop those involved let me use this platform to extend again the condolences of the nation to the victims of the appiatse explosion the response to the disaster by the public and the organs of state was highly commendable government responded swiftly in the immediate aftermath of the incident by dispatching a highpowered delegation to appiatse an appiatse support fund has been established to spearhead the building of a decent green and sustainable community to enable victims of this tragic incident and members of the community get back on their feet and rebuild their lives arising out of this incident government will ensure that the health and safety policies of the mining industry are in accordance with international best practice mr speaker the green ghana day last year was a great success as many people turned out to join in the exercise to plant trees i urge all of us to continue to take care of what we planted to make sure that the seven million seedlings we planted ie two million more than the original target of five million become fully grown trees and please join in the green ghana day when it comes along on  june the designated green ghana day for this year when we seek to plant twenty million trees that is a fourfold increase over the  target of five million mr speaker you would recollect that in my message to parliament last year i indicated that government is collaborating with the private sector to establish fourteen  medical waste treatment facilities and commence the construction of sixteen  integrated recycling and composting plants across the country to help address once and for all the safe disposal of medical and municipal solid waste i am happy to inform the house that these facilities and plants are at various levels of completion and will be completed by the end of this year mr speaker as part of governments water for all programme several water systems have been initiated and are at various stages of completion the import of the programme is to ensure that each region will benefit from at least one water supply project phases i and ii of the upper east region water supply project have been completed and will be commissioned soon contractors are on site working on the water projects in keta and sunyani and preparatory works are ongoing on the yendi damongo tamale and sekonditakoradi water projects mr speaker towards addressing the housing needs of ghanaians government has developed a new affordable housing programme with the state now playing the role of facilitator through the provision of land infrastructure services and tax incentives and exemptions to subsidize the cost of construction of the housing units to reduce their prices in furtherance of this preparatory works have commenced for the development of two designated sites at pokuase amasaman in the greater accra region and dedesua in the ashanti region which are expected to deliver some twelve thousand  housing units the long wait for decent and secure accommodation for public servants at the district levels will soon become a thing of the past government through the state housing company limited shcl has commenced works on the preparation of the district housing programme for the construction of rental housing units at the district level for public servants the pilot phase will be implemented in sixteen  districts across the sixteen  regions of the country that notwithstanding mr speaker government continues with the completion of the existing affordable housing projects to increase access to safe secure adequate and affordable housing units across the country tema development corporation tdc for example has continued with the construction of the kpone affordable housing project which involves the construction of three thousand and sixteen  housing units the project is currently thirty percent  complete mr speaker work is progressing on the coastal protection programme of government whose aim is to improve the resilience of the countrys coastline against tidal wave erosion whilst protecting lives livelihoods and properties of the people living along the coast accordingly the dansoman axim amanful kumah anomabu and elmina phase iii coastal protection projects are currently at  percent  percent  percent  percent and  percent respectively other coastal protection projects are currently ongoing at cape coast  percent dixcove  percent komenda  percent aboadze phase ii  percent and ningoprampram  percent in the medium term government will commence works at blekusu phase ii apam axim phase ii la and teshie dansoman phase ii shama ningoprampram section  tema new town anloga and takoradi mr speaker governments commitment to constructing a modern railway network in our country is gradually bearing fruit the construction of the twentytwo kilometre section of the western railway line on a new standard gauge from kojokrom to manso which commenced in  is on schedule to be completed before the end of this year ahead of its completion government has secured the needed funding to continue the western railway development project for an additional seventyeight kilometres  from manso to huni valley the project will also include the conversion of the dual gauge tracks between takoradi and kojokrom from narrow gauge to standard gauge mr speaker i am grateful to this house for considering and approving a commercial contract and a facility agreement of some four hundred and thirtynine million euros € to finance the development of another section of the western line from eduadin to obuasi covering a distance of fiftyone kilometres  a lot more attention will be paid this year towards securing additional resources to complete the development of the western line from awaso to link up with the bauxite deposits at nyinahin which will facilitate the development of the ghana integrated aluminum development corporation project mr speaker potentially one of the most decisive interventions of the  budget has been the youstart programme which has been established to encourage the development of entrepreneurship amongst the youth coupled with an even greater systematic support for the private sector which will be a priority of my second term it represents a major pathway for the economic growth and transformation of our country and for the solution of unemployment mr speaker i cannot purport to speak about the state of the nation without addressing some critical governance issues that have featured in recent public discussions certain elements have attempted to advocate coup détats as the answer to the problems of the nation we came through a long and tortuous journey to arrive at todays consensus on a multiparty democracy but the last twentynine  years of our  republic have shown that this has been the most productive period since our independence both the major political parties of the country the new patriotic party npp and the national democratic congress ndc have made positive contributions to this development there is work to be done on building our institutions but our democracy is worth fighting for it is up to us to find a way to accommodate each other and our differences to make things work for the benefit of the ghanaian people mr speaker it might also well be that coup détats have reentered our discourse because of the turmoil in our neighbourhood the west african region is suddenly back in the international headline news for all the wrong reasons we are back again as the region of political instability and the place for coups long and bitter experience led ecowas to its current stance of zero tolerance for military coups we in ghana know the cost of instability it leads to the exodus of our artisans and professionals and the emptying of teachers from our schools mr speaker today at every traffic light junction in our big towns and cities you can see the results of instability in our neighbourhood with the influx of refugees into our country we should be unapologetic about campaigning for stable democratic governments in our region we do not want to be an island of peace and stability in a region of turmoil we do not aspire to be prosperous in the midst of want and poverty we want a stable and prosperous ghana in a stable and prosperous region we should use our chairmanship and membership of ecowas our membership of the african union our membership of the commonwealth our membership of la francophonie and our position as a nonpermanent member of the un security council to advance these goals mr speaker taking into consideration the fact that covid infection numbers have fallen dramatically and on the advice of the covid taskforce i announced on sunday  march in the  update of the fellow ghanaians series the lifting of most of the restrictions that we have had to endure for the past two  years as the health experts have advised i hope we shall continue with some of the measures like the washing of hands and the enhanced hygiene protocols that have served us so well even though they are no longer mandatory i am sure we are all very relieved that the wearing of masks is no longer mandatory and we can hug our loved ones with the lifting of the covid restrictions i am looking forward to renewed energy and enthusiasm as all work places reopen at full capacity mr speaker despite the protracted and sometimes acrimonious nature of proceedings i am happy that the house has finally found it possible to pass the elevy bill i believe strongly the levy is going to make a significant contribution to revenue mobilisation and the management of the national economy and i want to thank members of the house for making this possible there are many problems that we have to overcome to get back to where we ought to be i need your support no president no parliament no government can undertake this task all by themselves we need all ghanaians to pull and push together the road to recovery will be hard and long mr speaker but we have started on a good footing by accepting that we are in a difficult place and are taking the difficult decisions that will get us out if anyone ever had any doubts about the need to be selfreliant the point has now been forcibly drilled home to us the pursuit of the ghana beyond aid agenda is even more compelling now i have no doubts whatsoever that we have it in us to build the ghana of our dreams i saw the spirit of togetherness and the willingness to help each other when covid struck we looked out for each other i saw the sense of enterprise and innovation of the ghanaian i saw our manufacturers quickly adapt their plants to produce sanitizers and our tailors equally quickly displayed the innovation they had always been known for by turning face masks into fashion items we have first class health professionals and they came into their own during the crisis and we are providing the infrastructure to enhance the quality of their work we have first class teachers they showed it when the pandemic struck and kept our children firmly to their books the selfconfidence of the ghanaian is well rooted let us more than ever hold our heads up high and face the future with courage hope and assurance let us recall our ageold ghanaian values of hard work enterprise solidarity dignity and hospitality look around you believe in ghana and be inspired by ghana we will bounce back together the battle is the lords may god bless us all and our homeland ghana and make her great and strong mr speaker i thank you for your attention   ghana is a west african country bound on the north by burkina faso on the east by togo on the south by the atlantic oceanand

       "'newly sworn members of the council of state let me start by congratulating all you distinguished ladies and gentlemen on your membership of the council of state some of you are here by virtue of institutional representation one exofficio and the others with the support of parliament some by virtue of having been elected as regional representatives and others having been appointed directly by the president of the republic we have no living former chief justice unfortunately to complete the composition whichever route you have taken you are now all members of this very august institution which in the wisdom of our constitution is the body to counsel the president in the performance of his functions members of the council our elders say that it is always better to get the benefit of two or more opinions than to rely on one viewpoint i believe the akan saying is tikro nko agyina in our custom therefore no matter how smart or how well endowed every chief or leader has a group of elders to advise him or her you are that body and luckily for me you come from different backgrounds and have a wide range of competence and experience which if properly harnessed will enable you perform effectively this all important function to this end it is my expectation and i believe the expectation of the entire nation that you will elect from among you a chairperson who will be equal to this task in our tradition of praise singing and grand titles it must be very tempting for a president to lapse into thinking that he is all powerful and able to do whatever he wants we have had the experience of presidents being accorded long and elaborate titles and being told that they are all powerful and cannot be contradicted members of the council it is in the light of such experience that the framers of our constitution found it necessary to establish a council of state to give impartial and objective advice to the president it is important therefore that regardless of whatever your background you would discharge your duties dispassionately this means that the council has a great responsibility it would be easy to fall into the wellknown temptation of telling the president what you think he wants to hear it would be equally tempting to tell the president he is the best thing that ever happened to ghana and it would be even more tempting to tell the president to ignore his critics i expect this council will not walk this road after almost  years of the  republic i think it is fair to say that the most effective council of state we have had has been the one that worked with president john agyekum kufuor we saw an intellectually vibrant and active council that took its responsibilities seriously we saw a council that kept its members well informed and kept government officials on their toes members of the council in my view the council is not an extension of the executive and you will not thus be representing the president or his ministers at functions i look forward very much to working with a council that will offer me straightforward advice based on unvarnished truth i look forward to working with a council that will help all of us deepen our democracy and i look forward to working with a council that will help us deliver a prosperous ghana such a council should not give advice to a president the effect of which is to undermine the independence of any of the other arms of government especially the judiciary the council has a broad scope of advisory functions in counselling the president it plays an important advisory role in the appointment of high officials of state like the chief justice of the republic the governor of the bank of ghana the heads of the nations security services officials of the presidents office and other critical officers of the state again according to article  the president can request the council to consider amendments to bills either before they are passed or even after they are passed by parliament further article  of the constitution gives the council what appears to be an unfettered remit to advise other bodies like parliament or any other authority in my view this is not meant to be a busybody charter but on matters of significant national importance the council can let its views be known there is though an important specific function which the constitution has conferred upon the council the council is to advise the president on the suitability or otherwise of the creation of a new region the councils advice is an integral part of the process for creating new regions this function is certainly going to be exercised during my presidency members of the council article   of the constitution requires the council to meet at least four times in a year at the moment i fear there is a lot of work piled up for the council and it might well turn out to be more like four times in a week that the council meets to be able to deal with the work on its table between the council and the presidency we have a lot of work to do to get all the appointments in place to get the government machinery to work i hope that we shall not insist on standing on ceremony but get to work rapidly and efficiently you can if you should so choose quickly get into the honourable and excellency mode and you will find many people to play you up to that role you can if you should so choose make your council one that is a rubber stamp you can if you should so choose make this council one that is widely respected and seen as the place to go for advice by all institutions and i am hoping this council will choose the latter path members of the council i have been given to understand that the state of the infrastructure for the council is not good work on the building started under president kufuor to house the council has been abandoned and the guest house for the use of members who come from out of town has also fallen into disrepair i hear the vehicles the council uses are in a poor state and i understand the secretariat has not got a chief director or a full complement of staff to help it perform its duties this is an unfortunate state of affairs i shall do my best to ensure that these matters are rectified promptly and the council is properly equipped to do its work members of the council you have been sworn into office at a difficult time in the history of our nation our economy is in poor shape we have challenges of governance especially the issue of corruption in public life we need to enhance the efficiency of the states administrative machinery in all these i expect you to be proactive partners in our efforts to find solutions that will improve the lives of our people i look forward to a vigorous exchange of ideas between us and it is my fervent wish and hope that this council will help enrich my presidency for the benefit of the ghanaian people so that together we can help realise the dreams of the founders of our nation to build a free united prosperous and happy ghana on the basis of the principles of democratic accountability respect for human rights and the rule of law and the dictates of social justice thank you may god bless you and bless our homeland ghana  ghana is a west african country bound on the north by burkina faso on the east by togo on the south by the atlantic oceanand on the west by côte divoire jubilee house

       "'we are gathered here this afternoon to perform one of the most significant acts in the life of our nation – the induction into office of a new chief justice of the republic it has been a simple solemn ceremony of investiture of the head of the judiciary the third arm of government to that end i am grateful for the presence of all of you many of you current or past holders of high public or other office especially for the presence of two of my predecessors the former presidents of the republic their excellencies jerry john rawlings and john agyekum kufuor my immediate predecessor his excellency john dramani mahama is as the lawyers say absent from the jurisdiction their participation in these proceedings speaks not only of the continuity of the institutions of the fourth republic for which we thank god but testifies also to the national character of this event the ghanaian people on tuesday  april  adopted by an overwhelming margin the provisions of the constitution of the fourth republic in the referendum of that day and resolved thereby to build under god a nation with a functioning democracy founded on the rule of law the commitment they made still resounds strongly twenty five years later and one of the most important actors in the preservation of this is the chief justice the decision in favour of multiparty democracy based on the separation of powers was guided by their belief that this was the surest path to progress and prosperity for our nation they did so in the words of the preamble of the constitution which with your indulgence i shall quote in extenso on this appropriate occasion in exercise of our natural and inalienable right to establish a framework of government which shall secure for ourselves and posterity the blessings of liberty equality of opportunity and prosperity  in a spirit of friendship and peace with all peoples of the world  and in solemn declaration and affirmation of our commitment to  freedom justice probity and accountability  the principle that all powers of government spring from the sovereign will of the people  the principle of universal adult suffrage  the rule of law  the protection and preservation of fundamental human rights and freedoms unity and stability for our nation  these brave words capture the essence of much of our history our unhappy experience with authoritarian rule and our determination to enter into a new era of freedom justice probity and accountability they have provided the platform for the fourth republic ushering us into the longest uninterrupted stable constitutional governance of independent ghana long may that continue so it is that final judicial power in the state under our constitution is vested solely in the judiciary and not in any other agency or organ of the state be it the presidency or the parliament the judiciary has jurisdiction in all matters of the breach of the law civil and criminal including matters relating to the interpretation and enforcement of the constitution it has thus onerous responsibilities to protect the individual liberties and fundamental human rights of citizens to act as the arbiter in disputes between the state and the citizen to act as the arbiter in disputes between citizens and to serve as the bulwark for the promotion of the orderly development of our nation and for the defence of the liberties and the rights of our people thus far the judiciary can be said generally to have discharged in the fourth republic its duties creditably and responsibly even though i was on the wrong end of the decision in the famous election petition of  a favourable decision on the day could have meant perhaps that this was my second term in office rather than the commencement of my mandate the attachment of the ghanaian people to the rule of law made it possible for us in the new patriotic party to entrust our fate to the highest court in the land in the aftermath of the disputed elections of  it also enabled the country to move on in unity and stability after the court handed down its verdict ghanaian democracy was enhanced by the decision of then chief justice georgina wood to broadcast the proceedings of the petition on television it helped in the process of demystifying judicial proceedings and helped send the clear message from the majority on the court that the controlling principle of judicial intervention in elections was the result delivered at the polling station which would not be easily reversed by a court it is a salutary message eleven days ago and three days short of ten years as chief justice georgina theodora wood stepped down from office into retirement as the twelfth chief justice the first female to head the judiciary and its longest serving leader her career has been extraordinary truly historic and amongst others she has the enviable record of having sworn into office three presidents of the republic the ultimate test of her leadership came two years ago during the dramatic exposé of corruption in the judiciary by one of the nations leading investigative journalists we have not yet lived down the trauma of the excruciating shock and embarrassment of seeing officers of our courts in such compromising situations she however quickly rose to the challenge and introduced reforms to restore some dignity to the judiciary and reestablish the confidence of ghanaians in it i pay warm tribute to her distinguished service to our nation and wish her a wellearned retirement even though her public service is still not over as she has now to take her place on the council of state as a former chief justice president kufuors judgement in selecting her for the office has been roundly vindicated it is critical for the growth of our nation that we have a judiciary that commands the respect of the people by the nature of its delivery of justice as well as by the comportment of its judges it is vitally important that we have judges who are honest possess integrity and a sound knowledge of the law the situation where judges proffer judgements on the basis of decisions from lower courts and cite them as law is not acceptable and even less so when judges cite no authority at all for their rulings and give orders without reasons our judges must be learned know their case law and ensure that their judgements are properly motivated that is the only way the rule of precedent the principle of stare decisis can operate which according to the wellknown common law doctrine promotes the evenhanded predictable and consistent development of legal principles fosters reliance on judicial decisions and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process i am confident that justice sophia abena boafoa akuffo will be an effective leader of the judiciary and will guard jealously its independence she will bring honour to the judiciary and to our country her attributes befitting the offspring of a prominent presbyterian priest – hard work discipline capacity for detailed research intimate knowledge of the law independence of mind and spirit honesty and integrity deepseated respect for the rule of law and for the best traditions of the legal profession abiding belief in the sovereignty of almighty god – will serve her well these are the characteristics which sustained her brilliant career as a lawyer and which propelled her to the notice of the  president of the  republic his excellency jerry john rawlings who appointed her to the supreme court on  november  some  years ago justice akuffo since then has been one of the leading lights of the court and her contribution to the courts work and the growth of our nations jurisprudence has been extensive she has justified the confidence reposed in her by president rawlings she has now to justify the confidence i am reposing in her as chief justice i congratulate her very much on her welldeserved appointment she will be walking in the footsteps of the twelve previous occupants of the office whose names read like a veritable whoswho of ghanas legal profession – arku korsah julius sarkodee addo edward akufoaddo ea lankwei bannerman samuel azu crabbe fred apaloo enp sowah philip archer isaac abban edward wiredu george acquah and gerogina wood i have no doubt however that in her we have a worthy successor to chief justice wood and the others who have gone before her i am certain that she will continue with chief justice woods agenda – redeeming the image of the judiciary and strengthening its accountability proceeding with the modernisation of judicial activities and establishing more specialist courts to improve the quality of judicial administration these should be the hallmarks of her tenure as chief justice i assure her of the full cooperation of my government as a genuine and trusted partner so that together the executive and the judiciary can cooperate in a spirit of mutual respect to realise the welfare and progress of our people i thank the leadership and members of the legislature parliament for the expeditious manner in which the parliamentary process of approval was undertaken in her case i use this occasion to assure the country that my government will not shield anyone found to have broken the laws of this country application of the laws of the land must occur in the words of the judicial oath without fear or favour affection or illwill and therefore without recourse to the political religious or ethnic affiliations of any citizen of the land when you fall foul of the law you must be dealt with accordingly and the law enforcement agencies including the judiciary must ensure this is done to persons perpetrating acts of lawlessness in the name of being members of the ruling party let me make it clear to you that you will find no shield in my government from the law recent disturbances in savelugu for example where allegedly a handful of party executives and youth are trying to prevent the municipal chief executive who has been duly appointed with the requisite approval of the municipal assembly from working are obviously unacceptable i urge the police to do everything in their power to bring to book all those who fall foul of the law we cannot have development which will bring jobs to our youth without order with the office of the special prosecutor in the offing to ensure the prosecution of public officials past and present who engage in acts of corruption and financial malfeasance it is my expectation that the judiciary will help facilitate the work of this body  let me extend my appreciation to justice william atuguba for holding the fort even if briefly as acting chief justice during the period of the retirement of chief justice georgina wood and the swearing into office today of chief justice sophia akuffo i observed that during the vetting process of justice sophia akuffo in parliament on friday june  he together with other members of the supreme court were present in parliament to lend their support to her nomination this was a highly commendable gesture i am hopeful that this same level of support will be extended as she assumes the mantle of head of the judiciary to her colleagues on the bench and to members of the bar i urge your continued solidarity and cooperation with the new chief justice to promote the rule of law that will be in line with the finest traditions of the bench and the bar and will help advance the welfare of our people we are determined to build a new ghanaian civilisation where the rule of law is not a slogan but an operating principle for the development of our state where the separation of powers is real and meaningful where public officials behave with honesty and integrity where the liberties and rights of our people are fully protected and where law and order provide a firm basis for our social and economic development so that the dreams of freedom and prosperity that animated the great patriots who founded our nation can find expression in our generation all of us from the public sector the security agencies the private sector the political parties the civil society the religious bodies and the traditional authorities have a joint responsibility to work together with our different views and our different perspectives for the ghana project – a united ghana governed according to the rule of law respect for individual liberties human rights and the principles of democratic accountability a ghana that meets fundamental requirements of social justice and solidarity and a ghana where we look past commodities to position our country in the global marketplace we should all work to free ourselves from a mindset of dependence aid charity and handouts and rather concentrate on mobilising ghanas own considerable resources to resolve ghanas problems it is a collective enterprise to which we should all commit
